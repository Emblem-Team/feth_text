one to stand idly by while my people get hurt. That's why,

I'd suggest that, rather than thrusting one of those clumsy

34843,MSGDATA,"I heard a rumor about you. I wonder if there's any
truth to it...",
34843,MSGDATA,Which one? You can't believe everything you hear.,
34843,MSGDATA,"If you say so. For now, let's just finish up so I can get
back to my nap.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Our hearts weren't really in that one, but we still
pulled it off well enough. Don't you think?",
34843,MSGDATA,"You wouldn't stop staring at me, so I was in a rush to
get it over with as quickly as possible.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Linny, why did you keep staring at me? That really
got on my nerves.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Oh, it's nothing. I just couldn't stop thinking about
that rumor I heard. I'll watch you in secret next time.",
34843,MSGDATA,"If you get tired, feel free to take a break. Maybe we
can take turns or something.",
34843,MSGDATA,"You'd do that for me, huh? Wow, that's nice of you.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Nah, I'm thinking of myself. I don't feel like facing
off with a demonic beast today.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Gotta say, Linny did a good job. It all went pretty
smoothly thanks to him.",
34843,MSGDATA,"I'm just glad it's over. If I don't get to sleep soon,
I'm going to die.",
34843,MSGDATA,"I'd say these results are...acceptable. You can't say
we didn't try our hardest.",
34843,MSGDATA,"There's no need to put a positive spin on it. Are you
worried about hurting my feelings or something?",
34843,MSGDATA,"Let's wrap this up quickly so that we can get back
down there. I wanna find the book today.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Rushing doesn't help anyone. If we're stuck doing
this, we'd better at least be deliberate.",
34843,MSGDATA,"I don't wanna spend my whole life doing this. Show a
little initiative for once.",
34843,MSGDATA,That was kind of perfect. We work well together.,
34843,MSGDATA,"We've been working way too hard lately.
Don't you think?",
34843,MSGDATA,"Research shows that the harder people work, the less
efficient they are. In that spirit, I'm overdue for
a nap.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Hey, we're in the middle of explaining— Oh, fine.
I guess you got the gist.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Are there any foods you particularly dislike, Hapi?
Anything in today's meal, for instance?",
34843,MSGDATA,"Nope. But also, none of your business.",
34843,MSGDATA,"Usually the atmosphere in the dining hall kinda
bums me out, but with you two, I think I'll be OK.",
34843,MSGDATA,"None of us are great at reading a room. Isn't that
right, Professor?",
34843,MSGDATA,"I overheard someone call us The Three Oddballs.
Not very clever, if you ask me.",

31992,SUPPORT,"In the Imperial year 185, the construction of
Garreg Mach was completed. Saint Seiros held a
sacred ritual to honor the occasion. Four saints,
known as the Four Apostles, were led to a tranquil
place to perform the ritual.",
31992,SUPPORT,"The Four Apostles poured their holy essences into
the Chalice of Beginnings—a gift from the goddess
herself—in hopes of bringing about her second
coming. Alas, the Rite of Rising failed...",
31992,SUPPORT,"Bearing the blame for the ritual's failure, the
Four Apostles left the monastery, all but vanishing
from the land.",
31992,SUPPORT,"The first sought the lush forest of Adrestia's
mountains. The second traversed Fodlan's Fangs,
settling on the ocean's salted shores. The third
traveled to the mountains, vanishing beneath their
lofty peaks. And the fourth faded into shadow in a
town untouched by day's light.",
31992,SUPPORT,"Nothing but legend remains of the Four Apostles,
their offering to the Nabatean chalice, and the
goddess who never returned.",
32005,SUPPORT,Excuse me! Sorry to intrude!,Извините! Извините за вторжение!
32005,SUPPORT,"Please, forgive the disruption, Lady Rhea, but I have
that report you asked for.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Do not worry yourself, Alois. As it happens, I am
presently unoccupied. Please, go on.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Ah, great! I'll just... Huh? What's that book you've
got there?",
32005,SUPPORT,"It is a chronicle covering the 995 years since
Garreg Mach Monastery's completion.",
32005,SUPPORT,Huh! Sounds like a good read.,
32005,SUPPORT,"Maintaining the church's records is one of the duties
entrusted to all archbishops, myself included.",
32005,SUPPORT,"This one states that Saint Seiros ordered the
monastery's construction after the end of
the War of Heroes.",
32005,SUPPORT,"This is a rare and valuable text. Most documents of
that era have been lost to time.",
32005,SUPPORT,"I see, I see... Time aside, we also lost many books in
that massive fire 21 years ago...",
32005,SUPPORT,"Indeed. What was once well documented exists now
only in this chronicle.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Not least of which is the ceremony commemorating
the monastery's completion.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Interesting! I'll admit, I know the year it took place
but not a thing beyond that.",
32005,SUPPORT,"That is to be expected, unfortunately.",
32005,SUPPORT,"According to this chronicle, the Rite of Rising was
held during the ceremony. The intent was to bring
about the goddess's rebirth.",
32005,SUPPORT,"The Rite of Rising, eh? Hm, can't say I've ever heard
of that one.",
32005,SUPPORT,"I am not surprised. There should be countless
records documenting that important ritual.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Alas... Today, all we have to go on are fragments
of forgotten memories and our own imaginations.",
32005,SUPPORT,"One thing is clear... Their wish for the goddess's
return was most fervent.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Saint Seiros held the ritual along with the Four
Apostles: Noa, Chevalier, Timotheos, and Aubin.",
32005,SUPPORT,"However, it did not bear fruit, as the goddess did not
return to this world... So it is written.",
32005,SUPPORT,"I've never heard of the Four Apostles before.
They're different from the Four Saints, right?",
32005,SUPPORT,"That is correct. Today, almost no records exist of the
Four Apostles.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Their names live on only in the names of their
Crests, but the bloodlines bearing those tokens
of the past have been lost.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Any deeper knowledge of the apostles has all but
disappeared from the grand stage of history.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Well, that's interesting. Does that mean they're
somewhere...backstage?",
32005,SUPPORT,"In a sense. It is possible that their bloodlines have
carried on in secret, perhaps materializing where
no one thought to look.",
32005,SUPPORT,"I had not intended to indulge in such a long-winded
lecture.",
32005,SUPPORT,"Please, tell me your report, Alois. It concerns the
underground, does it not?",
32005,SUPPORT,"Oh, right! It's as you suspected. Recently, there
have been several incidents in the area beneath
Garreg Mach...",
32006,SUPPORT,"Claude... Are you certain that suspicious individual
you spotted went through...there?",
32006,SUPPORT,"I will say, that does look a bit like a passageway,
doesn't it?",
32006,SUPPORT,"Unless I dreamt it up while sleepwalking, there's no
mistaking what I saw.",
32006,SUPPORT,"I never thought I'd say this...but I believe
Claude's story.",
32006,SUPPORT,"In fact, it reminds me of something. I have heard
tales of countless passages snaking beneath Garreg
Mach. This is undoubtedly one of them.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Perhaps so. In any case, there is no telling where
it leads.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Oh no. Oh, you're right! There's no telling what we
could find. Terrible danger. Wicked creatures. 
Unspeakable smells!",
32006,SUPPORT,"The risk is too high, Your Highnesses! I must
humbly insist that you wait here, where it's safe...
and smells nice.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Meanwhile, Teach and I will track down the bandit-
shaped person. If we don't return, do me a favor and
call for the knights, will ya?",
32006,SUPPORT,"That is quite enough. As though we would allow you
to make that call on your own.",
32006,SUPPORT,"With so little information, it's far too dangerous.
We'll come along as well. Right, Dimitri?",
32006,SUPPORT,"Yes, of course. If it was indeed a thief, we must not
allow them to get away with their crime.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Considering what took place at the Goddess's Rite of
Rebirth, vigilance is paramount.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Right, well, tag along if you insist. Just don't come
crying to me if we all meet a terrible fate, deal?",
32006,SUPPORT,"Likewise. Well, no use dallying. Let's be on our way.
Unless there's someone else we should call for?",
32006,SUPPORT,The four of us should suffice.,
32006,SUPPORT,"We should bring more allies, just to be safe.",
32006,SUPPORT,Perhaps we should alert the knights.,
32006,SUPPORT,Teach is right. There isn't a moment to lose.,
32006,SUPPORT,"Yes, a fine idea. Though at this time, I fear few of
our classmates are still awake.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Hmm... I fear our thief will have long escaped in the
time it would take us to summon the knights.",
32006,SUPPORT,"True, and most of them are currently away,
investigating the Western Church.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Whoa there! What's all this, Professor? You and the
three house leaders creeping around at night?
Pretty shady, if you ask me.",
32006,SUPPORT,"It's certainly a rare and unexpected sighting...
especially considering the hour.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Looks like a whole lot of something is about to
happen. I'm going back to bed.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Stop right there, Linhardt. Your bad luck is our good
fortune—you're coming with us.",
32006,SUPPORT,"You can stop thinking of ways out of this, Hilda.
We could use your help too.",
32006,SUPPORT,"You as well, Ashe. I'll explain everything on the way.",
32006,SUPPORT,"Happy to help! We don't have anything better to do
at this hour, so we may as well pitch in.",
32006,SUPPORT,"You have our gratitude. Now then, let us be on our
way. Ready, Professor?",
32006,SUPPORT,"The more the merrier, I suppose. Let's just hope
we're not all marching to our doom...",
32007,SUPPORT,"Ugh... Yuri, this is brutal. Tell me again why you're
subjecting me to this devastating boredom...",
32007,SUPPORT,"Enough with the yawning, Balthus. If you're really
that bored, we could always make a friendly wager...",
32007,SUPPORT,"Thanks but no thanks, pal. I'm low on funds as it is.
Last thing I need is another debt I can't pay.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Right, B. As if you could say no to that.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! How diverting that you should bicker for
my amusement!",
32007,SUPPORT,"Imagine my overwhelming dread were I stuck here
without such joyous entertainment.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Count me out. I'll leave the talking to Yuri-bird
and Coco.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Hey, Boss!",
32007,SUPPORT,"Back already, huh? Have you detected any
movement on the surface?",
32007,SUPPORT,"Well, uh, I looked for the cardinals' meeting—just
like you said...",
32007,SUPPORT,"Thing is, I was spotted by some weirdos.
They chased after me and everything.",
32007,SUPPORT,"""Some weirdos,"" you say. So very helpful. They
weren't knights, were they?",
32007,SUPPORT,"I dunno. There were only a few of 'em, but I bet
they were armed to the teeth!",
32007,SUPPORT,"With meager numbers like that, I doubt they intend
to take on Abyss.",
32007,SUPPORT,"They probably took you for some kind of villain.
They'll lock ya up if they catch ya.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Finally, a little action! Let's find them first and throw
some punches.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Hold, Balthus! 'Tis ignorance itself to rush headfirst
into trouble.",
32007,SUPPORT,"You're excited to fight too. You've been waiting for a
chance to try out your shiny new magic.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Heh heh, surface laws don't apply down here. That
gives us the freedom to have some fun with them.",
32007,SUPPORT,"They're probably not knights, but our new friends
definitely work for the church.",
32007,SUPPORT,You had best not leave me behind!,
32007,SUPPORT,"Hmm... It seems this place is more than a simple
passageway. There's clear evidence of human
habitation.",
32007,SUPPORT,"People living under Garreg Mach... Oh! My brother
used to tell me stories like that back in his Academy
days.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Ah, so Holst attended the academy as well, then?",
32007,SUPPORT,"Of course. Back then, there were tons of rumors
about what goes on below Garreg Mach.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Something about tons of passages and houses beneath
the town, all inhabited by super-shady people.",
32007,SUPPORT,"It had a real intimidating name too. Ah, what was it
again... I think it was called...Abyss?!",
32007,SUPPORT,"That's two points for the pink-haired gal!
Welcome to Abyss, strangers.",
32007,SUPPORT,Identify yourself!,
32007,SUPPORT,That uniform...,
32007,SUPPORT,"Welcome, curious students of the Officers Academy!
What brings such fine, upstanding surface dwellers
to our humble abode?",
32007,SUPPORT,"We're tracking someone who was creeping around
the monastery.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Our business here does not concern you. Do you
intend to let us pass?",
32007,SUPPORT,Ahaha! Such indulgence simply cannot be permitted.,
32007,SUPPORT,"Your words may fool the fool, but I cannot be so
easily deceived!",
32007,SUPPORT,"I, Constance von Nuvelle, shall divine your true
intentions.",
32007,SUPPORT,"You are here by order of the church...which cruelly
plots to eliminate the inhabitants of Abyss!",
32007,SUPPORT,You think the church wants to eliminate you?,
32007,SUPPORT,You think we're here to harm you?,
32007,SUPPORT,Did she say...Nuvelle?,
32007,SUPPORT,"I don't care what the reason for this brawl is.
A fight's on the menu, and I'm ready to feast.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Let's get right to it, yeah?",
32007,SUPPORT,"By the look of them, I'd wager they're experienced
combatants. I'm not certain this is a wise endeavor.",
32007,SUPPORT,"I was thinking the very same thing. Time to make a
strategic retreat, then?",
32007,SUPPORT,"Turning back already? Oh, but you'll make me so
sad. Now why would you wanna do that?",
32007,SUPPORT,"Everyone here is starved for amusement. They've
been waiting for a good fight.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Wow, look at that. A flawless example of a surprise
attack. These aren't your run-of-the-mill thugs.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Claude, this isn't the time to be impressed by our
enemy. We must find a way through at once.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Wait... Claude, is it? As in the brand-new heir
of House Riegan?",
32007,SUPPORT,"Who, me? Nah. Wrong guy. Claude's a common
name in Fódlan. It's just too dashing for new moms
to pass up.",
32007,SUPPORT,"It's even a popular choice for fake names. Just a
good, solid, all-purpose moniker, you know?",
32007,SUPPORT,"Right, except there's only one Claude enrolled at the
academy this year. Looks like that's you.",
32007,SUPPORT,How do you even know that?,
32007,SUPPORT,"Ha, you just gave yourself away, pal. Looks like my
luck's finally taking a turn for the good.",
32007,SUPPORT,"All right, so your choices are as follows: line up for
the beating of a lifetime...or let us lock you up like
the good boys and girls you undoubtedly are.",
32007,SUPPORT,"I have no clue what this guy's going on about, but it
looks like a fight's in order, and it's pretty much all
my fault.",
32007,SUPPORT,"There's a saying from the east about fighting a flicker
with a flame. Seems applicable right about now.",
32007,SUPPORT,"Finally! Let's do this already! Prepare to face the
Almighty King of Grappling!",
32007,SUPPORT,"Hm... Why can't I shake the feeling that I know
that wild man?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Heh, I don't believe it. Little Hilda herself.
Why didn't you speak up sooner?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Baltie, this isn't the time to catch up. What would
Holst think?! I bet you didn't consider that, did you?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Yeesh... I dunno, but it wouldn't be nice.",
32008,SUPPORT,...,
32008,SUPPORT,"Look, sorry. OK? Just don't tell Holst. If he knew
I raised a hand against you, he'd have my head.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Ha! Like he'd stop at your head. Fine though.
Just this once, and just for you, I'll keep quiet.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Now that that's sorted... What did you mean about
it being lucky that you found me?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Oh, that. One of the guys I owe gold to is
Count Gloucester.",
32008,SUPPORT,"He said something about forgiving my debt if I could
dig up some dirt on you. Figured this was my shot.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Aha, so it was purely selfish. But then, was a fight
really necessary?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Really was. Best way to acquaint yourself with
someone is to get into a tussle with 'em.
That's common sense right there.",
32008,SUPPORT,That makes sense.,
32008,SUPPORT,That doesn't sound right...,
32008,SUPPORT,"Huh. I had no idea there were others like B
out there.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Who knew such a refined lady could be so
backwards.",
32008,SUPPORT,"That's the correct response for a reasonable person.
We're not all as far gone as Balthus here.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Say what you will, but I learned all I need to know.
It's clear this lot has nothing to do with the church's
intentions.",
32008,SUPPORT,"But that means those other creeps could always
attack us at any moment.",
32008,SUPPORT,What creeps?,
32008,SUPPORT,Who would attack you?,
32008,SUPPORT,"Someone's targeting Abyss. Mercenaries keep sniffing
around and causing trouble here. They won't let up.",
32008,SUPPORT,"It's a real problem, and we have no clue who's
pulling the strings.",
32008,SUPPORT,"There are many within the church who would love
to see this ""filthy"" underground city purged.",
32008,SUPPORT,"When you first showed up, we thought you were
here to do just that. Apologies for the confusion.",
32008,SUPPORT,"So that's why you came at us with that nasty ""kill the
outsiders"" act.",
32008,SUPPORT,"As Yuri-bird said, we're sorry. We're all pretty on
edge these days.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Indeed! That someone would descend to Abyss out
of pure curiosity was far too outlandish to consider.",
32008,SUPPORT,What is the purpose of Abyss?,
32008,SUPPORT,"No idea. These tunnels have been around for ages.
They could be older than the monastery for all
we know.",
32008,SUPPORT,"None remain who know the complete truth.
However, I shall tell you all that we know for
certain...",
32008,SUPPORT,"Abyss is home to those who shun the light of day.
It is the secret shadow of Garreg Mach, if you will.",
32008,SUPPORT,"The church quietly tolerates us. They think they
need a place like this for Garreg Mach to thrive.",
32008,SUPPORT,"The deal is simple. Abyssians never get involved with
the surface, and the surface never gets involved
with us.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Alas! For some foul reason, surface dwellers have
been after us of late.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Further oppressing those souls who can only find
solace beneath the ground? I cannot abide it!",
32008,SUPPORT,"Though it pains me to admit, we, too, harbor valid
reasons for not venturing into the light.",
32008,SUPPORT,"That is why, by the grace of our esteemed patron,
we have been granted sanctuary here in Abyss.",
32008,SUPPORT,"I see... Baltie, does that mean you've got a reason
for being here too?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Afraid so, Hilda. I'm here because...there are more
bounties on my head than there is hair. Needed to
lay low. Real low.",
32008,SUPPORT,Baltie... That's awful.,
32008,SUPPORT,"Enough with the niceties. Let's get these surface
dwellers out of here.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Nonsense! Intolerable nonsense! Whyever would we
let slip this chance to acquire their aid?",
32008,SUPPORT,You need our help?,
32008,SUPPORT,We refuse to get involved.,
32008,SUPPORT,"Easy there, pal. Can't say no before we've even asked
for anything. Talk is cheap, but listening's free, yeah?",
32008,SUPPORT,"Like we said, recently this place is being targeted
by mercenaries.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Myself excluded, a lot of the folks who live here can't
defend themselves. They're here to avoid conflict.",
32008,SUPPORT,"The elderly, the infirm...orphans, lost souls...
merchants who were chewed up and spit out
by the nobility. The works.",
32008,SUPPORT,"It rests upon us to protect those who cannot protect
themselves...and to safeguard our home.",
32008,SUPPORT,"To that noble end, I must insist that you lend us
your strength!",
32008,SUPPORT,"I feel for your cause, truly. However, I cannot help
but wonder why you would trust us so readily.
We are from the surface, after all.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Trust is a choice. We're choosing to trust you. For
now. It's clear you're not here by command of
the church.",
32008,SUPPORT,"And you're not just a bunch of noble twerps, either.
You can hold your own. It's in the way you fight.
How you carry yourselves.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Still... I'm reluctant to get you involved with
this madness. It's our problem, not yours.",
32008,SUPPORT,"It's too late now—we already told them everything.
Let's at least give them a chance to decide for
themselves.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Most true. Wander about Abyss for a time and I am
certain you will come to the only correct conclusion.",
32008,SUPPORT,"Right, what she said. Take a look, think some
thoughts. Consider yourselves our special guests.",
32009,SUPPORT,"We're all done here, Boss. Oh, but more importantly,
about your—",
32009,SUPPORT,"We'll discuss that another time. For now, tend to
your mission.",
32009,SUPPORT,"Don't worry. No one will die. We'll get everyone
out safely.",
32009,SUPPORT,Hmm...,
32009,SUPPORT,"Once the trap is set, shift your focus to protecting
the Abyssians, just in case things go south.",
32009,SUPPORT,What was that about?,
32009,SUPPORT,"Oh, it's you.",
32009,SUPPORT,"I was just heading off to ambush our attackers.
You'll help with that, won't you?",
32009,SUPPORT,Oh? Does that mean your enemies are drawing near?,
32009,SUPPORT,"Very good! Heh. The scouts I sent to the surface
spotted some mercenaries.",
32009,SUPPORT,"We closed off the entrance they used last, but it
seems they've already found another.",
32009,SUPPORT,"This is bad! We've got to evacuate everyone from
Abyss as quickly as possible.",
32009,SUPPORT,That won't be necessary. They'll be back soon.,
32009,SUPPORT,Huh? Who?,
32009,SUPPORT,"Why do I have to go? No matter what we do, we're
all just gonna die in the end anyway.",
32009,SUPPORT,"Sure, but if we do nothing, we'll die a lot sooner.
I assume the corridor is successfully camouflaged?",
32009,SUPPORT,"But of course! Our decoys shall prevent those
scoundrels from chancing upon our living quarters.",
32009,SUPPORT,"Do note that I am the bait upon your hook. If we
fail, I shall be left dangling in the wind.",
32009,SUPPORT,"Aha! But it must be done, I fear! And so I will most
happily accept the starring role in this—",
32009,SUPPORT,"They're at the entrance. They'll be coming in from
the east.",
32009,SUPPORT,...,
32009,SUPPORT,"The east... Good. We're well placed. Go ahead and
draw them deeper into Abyss, just like we planned.",
32009,SUPPORT,You're drawing them in?,
32009,SUPPORT,Why are they targeting Abyss?,
32009,SUPPORT,"I'd like to know that myself. But first things first.
We've got to make it through this encounter.",
32009,SUPPORT,"Launching small counterattacks on the surface won't
accomplish anything. It could also earn us the scorn
of the church, if it gets messy...which it will.",
32009,SUPPORT,"That's why we have to lure the enemy underground
before we take them out. I know the perfect spot.",
32009,SUPPORT,"Admit it, pals. You're knee-deep in this, just like us.
There's no turning back now, right?",
32009,SUPPORT,"Of course not! If there's any way we can help your
cause, we won't turn our backs on you.",
32009,SUPPORT,"That's right. We will not stand idly by while danger
befalls the innocent people of Abyss.",
32009,SUPPORT,"If we can capture the enemy, we can perhaps learn
the reason behind their relentless attacks.",
32009,SUPPORT,We'll fight at your side.,
32009,SUPPORT,We have no choice...,
32009,SUPPORT,"Excited, are you? Fine. We could use more bodies to
throw at our enemies. Thanks for volunteering.",
32009,SUPPORT,How insensitive! Your lack of excitement stings.,
32009,SUPPORT,"So long as they're fighting with us and not against us,
I don't care how excited they are. Let's get to it!",
32010,SUPPORT,"Wow. An underground arena, huh? You sure know
some great spots, Yuri.",
32010,SUPPORT,"I heard about this place from someone back in town.
It hasn't been in use for a long time.",
32010,SUPPORT,"I figured it could prove useful, so I spent some
time clearing out the debris that was blocking the
entrance.",
32010,SUPPORT,"It seems to be a revitalized ruin... Perhaps it was
originally a reception hall or something similar.",
32010,SUPPORT,"Perhaps. Honestly, all of Abyss feels like a ruin.",
32010,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! This place is magnificent! It is just spacious
enough to contain my glory! I shall not hold back
here!",
32010,SUPPORT,"Large. Isolated. I wonder if it would be OK for me to
sigh here...",
32010,SUPPORT,Sigh?,
32010,SUPPORT,"If Hapi sighs, monsters come running. No, I'm
not kidding.",
32010,SUPPORT,I'm not sure what you could possibly mean by that...,
32010,SUPPORT,"I wish, Hapi, but no. Absolutely no sighing. And,
Constance, be glorious in moderation.",
32010,SUPPORT,"Understood? This place is so big that if it collapses,
all of Abyss will fall with it.",
32010,SUPPORT,"The whole reason we're luring our enemies here is to
avoid damaging Abyss. Don't lose sight of that.",
32010,SUPPORT,I am well aware of our aim!,
32010,SUPPORT,"Sure, but that doesn't mean we can trust you to
show restraint.",
32010,SUPPORT,I'm concerned.,
32010,SUPPORT,Don't get carried away.,
32010,SUPPORT,"You as well?! I cannot fathom why I am being treated
in such a way.",
32010,SUPPORT,"It is the duty of the nobility to preserve the people's
safety.",
32010,SUPPORT,"Do you truly believe that I would destroy Abyss in
my efforts to save it? Preposterous!",
32010,SUPPORT,That would cause trouble for Elfie too.,
32010,SUPPORT,"If the underground collapses, he's the one who
will have to answer for it.",
32010,SUPPORT,Who is Elfie?,
32010,SUPPORT,"You must know Aelfric, yeah? He's a big wig in the
church, but a friend of Abyss.",
32010,SUPPORT,"He's the one who opened up this place to folks with
nowhere else to turn. Folks like us. He gave us a
home, a new life.",
32010,SUPPORT,"It is Aelfric himself who put forth the idea of
establishing the Ashen Wolf House.",
32010,SUPPORT,"Sadly, he faces opposition within the church, and so
he cannot openly deploy the knights to aid us.",
32010,SUPPORT,"That means Aelfric relies upon us to protect the
people who live here. Us...and now you.",
32010,SUPPORT,"I hope you're ready, Professor. We're counting
on you.",
32010,SUPPORT,Professor?,
32010,SUPPORT,We won't let you down.,
32010,SUPPORT,"You are a professor at the Officers Academy, are
you not?",
32010,SUPPORT,"You may not be our instructor, but I cannot think of
a more fitting title to call you.",
32010,SUPPORT,Seems like you're with us now. We'll owe you one.,
32010,SUPPORT,"Reliable, aren't you? We'll owe you one.",
32010,SUPPORT,"Time to knock some sense into their thick skulls.
They picked the wrong strangers to mess with!",
32011,SUPPORT,"Aelfric! How serendipitous that you have come to
our aid!",
32011,SUPPORT,"I am relieved that I wasn't too late. I do hope my
presence proved useful.",
32011,SUPPORT,No doubt about it. We needed the backup.,
32011,SUPPORT,"So, you're Aelfric...",
32011,SUPPORT,You're with the church...,
32011,SUPPORT,"Professor. I do believe this is the first time our paths
have crossed, is it not?",
32011,SUPPORT,"Of course, I have heard all about you from Her
Grace, the archbishop.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Aelfric. The
church has granted me custodianship of Abyss.",
32011,SUPPORT,You look after Abyss?,
32011,SUPPORT,Pleased to meet you.,
32011,SUPPORT,"Indeed. And despite my responsibilities, I am but a
humble monk.",
32011,SUPPORT,The pleasure is all mine.,
32011,SUPPORT,"I am sure you have already been told about Abyss's
unique situation.",
32011,SUPPORT,"For varying reasons, all of the inhabitants here are
unable to live a peaceful life on the surface.",
32011,SUPPORT,"People like the Dagdans and Almyrans, who suffer
undue persecution across Fódlan.",
32011,SUPPORT,"The poor and the sick, who were forced into Abyss.
Not to mention all the other unfortunate souls who
ended up here.",
32011,SUPPORT,"I believe it is my sacred duty to provide a place for
those who have nowhere else to go.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Right. And the poor and sick living in a sunless
crypt helps them...how?",
32011,SUPPORT,"Enough, Claude. Please forgive my friend, Aelfric.
We would love to hear more.",
32011,SUPPORT,"In all honesty, I understand his concern. I dearly
wish I could provide a better life for my flock.",
32011,SUPPORT,"But it would appear that Her Grace and most of the
church consider the existence of Abyss to be...
something of a nuisance.",
32011,SUPPORT,A nuisance?,
32011,SUPPORT,That can't be true.,
32011,SUPPORT,"I'm afraid so... Those within the church who would
see Abyss purged are swiftly growing in number.",
32011,SUPPORT,"No? I've heard tell of those within the church who
intend to purge Abyss.",
32011,SUPPORT,"That's the church for you. They make a big deal out
of helping the helpless...when it suits them.",
32011,SUPPORT,"We can't just sit back and accept the way things are.
We've gotta fight the system!",
32011,SUPPORT,"Sure, I'm here to hide from literally countless
bounty hunters, but I'm not the only one in need.",
32011,SUPPORT,"You're in a bad way too, Hapi. We can't just let the
church walk all over us.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Too true. For the sake of all who dwell in Abyss, we
must help dear Aelfric to turn the tide!",
32011,SUPPORT,"I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Your fervent
support is all the reward I could ask for.",
32011,SUPPORT,"As for you, Professor, I must beg a favor of you.",
32011,SUPPORT,What's the favor?,
32011,SUPPORT,"The Ashen Wolves are a house in name alone. They
are eager students with no teacher to guide them...",
32011,SUPPORT,"If you could find it in your heart to take them under
your wing, I would be most grateful.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Naturally, your official duties take precedence, so
you need only help out when your schedule allows.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Wait a minute, Aelfric. Where's this nonsense
coming from?",
32011,SUPPORT,"I second that question! We have no need of a
professor when we have you.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Dear flock, I am a mere guardian. I can protect you,
but I cannot enrich your minds.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Though I call this gathering an academy house,
I have long lamented that it isn't truly so.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Now, I am blessed with the opportunity to correct
this. The professor who stands before you has
garnered a great deal of acclaim on the surface.",
32011,SUPPORT,"A most trustworthy and esteemed teacher, to say the
least. What's more, I happen to be acquainted with
the father of this fine individual.",
32011,SUPPORT,How do you know my father?,
32011,SUPPORT,When did you meet my father?,
32011,SUPPORT,I met Jeralt back when he was a knight.,
32011,SUPPORT,"I was born and raised in Garreg Mach, so I often
had the opportunity to spend time with him.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Your mother, as well... She was a cherished friend
of mine. I was even present for their wedding.",
32011,SUPPORT,"With parents like yours, I have no doubt that you
possess the kindness and patience necessary to guide
these students.",
32011,SUPPORT,But...,
32011,SUPPORT,It'll be fine. It's not like we're strangers anymore.,
32011,SUPPORT,"Say, Aelfric... Don't you need to take care of
those thieves?",
32011,SUPPORT,"Ah, right you are. Please, excuse me.",
32011,SUPPORT,"Oh, and one more thing, Professor...",
32011,SUPPORT,"If ever you would like to hear more about your
parents, I would be delighted to share my memories
with you.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Ah, Professor. To what do I owe this pleasure?",
32012,SUPPORT,I want to hear more about my parents.,
32012,SUPPORT,"Ah, yes, of course you do. I will gladly tell you all
that I know.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Where to begin... If you have something particular in
mind, please ask and I shall answer as best I can.",
32012,SUPPORT,Tell me about my mother.,
32012,SUPPORT,What was my father like back then?,
32012,SUPPORT,"Kind. And wise. I would often see her in the library,
her nose always buried in a book.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Jeralt was...very much then as he is now. His knights
would have done just about anything for him.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Whenever he had time to spare, he would instruct
the children of the monastery in combat and tactics.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Just like those wide-eyed youngsters, your mother
and I made a hero of him in our minds.",
32012,SUPPORT,"When I learned that Jeralt and Sitri were to be
married, I was quite surprised.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Back then, Jeralt was something of a mentor to me.",
32012,SUPPORT,"As for Sitri... She found it difficult to express her
emotions.",
32012,SUPPORT,"It was only when she was gazing at Jeralt that I ever
saw her smile...a smile that rivaled the very sun.",
32012,SUPPORT,"His tales of the outside world must have seemed like
a lifeline for one as frail and guarded as she.",
32012,SUPPORT,The outside world?,
32012,SUPPORT,Frail?,
32012,SUPPORT,"Indeed. She lacked the strength to travel beyond
the monastery.",
32012,SUPPORT,"The only souls she ever spoke with were a select few
within the monastery walls.",
32012,SUPPORT,"I can picture it now, the stories he told her...
His striking words and his boisterous laugh.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Listening to him must have given her a great deal
of hope.",
32012,SUPPORT,"As for me, I could never have become like Jeralt,
as much as I wished for it.",
32012,SUPPORT,You wanted to be like him?,
32012,SUPPORT,"Ah, I suppose I did. He would tell stories from a
century ago as though he had lived them himself.",
32012,SUPPORT,"No matter how fervently one studies the stories of
old, that is no easy task.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Professor, you traveled with Jeralt before coming
here. You must have seen a great many things, yes?",
32012,SUPPORT,"Forgive me for overstepping, but do you not regret
forgoing your travels to take up residence here?",
32012,SUPPORT,The archbishop requested my service.,
32012,SUPPORT,I enjoy my work here.,
32012,SUPPORT,"I see. Well, so long as you are satisfied, it is not my
place to question your decision.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Heh heh, well then! I suppose I have no choice but
to assist you as best I can.",
32012,SUPPORT,"To shape young minds must afford you a unique
perspective on the world.",
32012,SUPPORT,"I am certain my unsolicited advice is nothing but a
nuisance, but please hear me out...",
32012,SUPPORT,"It is my hope that you will live a full life—
experiencing the world, fostering strong
relationships with people.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Do so for dear Sitri, whose wish to experience such
things shall regretfully never be granted.",
32012,SUPPORT,That's why you asked me to teach the Ashen Wolves?,
32012,SUPPORT,"I cannot deny it. It is my own stubborn notion.
One that Her Grace will likely not think kindly of.",
32012,SUPPORT,"Beyond my personal motive, I believe that you alone
can guide my flock to even greater heights.",
32012,SUPPORT,And perhaps you will learn from them as well.,
32012,SUPPORT,"Ah, but I have taken enough of your precious time.
Know that I am here for you, always.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Pray tell, Yuri. Did those foul bandits whom we
bested at the arena confess to anything?",
32013,SUPPORT,"Not a word. And they wouldn't name names. I got
the feeling they didn't know much themselves.",
32013,SUPPORT,"However, one thing is clear. Whoever hired them is
after something here in Abyss.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Yeah, that's gotta be it. They must have been on a
treasure hunt or something.",
32013,SUPPORT,"A treasure hunt here? I don't get it. What is there to
find in these dingy tunnels?",
32013,SUPPORT,"Aelfric, was it? Looks like this is ringing a bell
for you.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Well, something does come to mind, but the notion
is preposterous at best.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Never discount a wild hunch. Sometimes they're
closer to the truth than you'd think.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Any lead will do, so long as it helps determine our
next course of action. Please, go on.",
32013,SUPPORT,"As you wish, though again, it is quite far-fetched.
You see, there is a longstanding legend here.",
32013,SUPPORT,"It is said that deep underground, below even Abyss,
is a place called the Chasm of the Bound wherein
lies the Chalice of Beginnings.",
32013,SUPPORT,The Chalice of Beginnings?,
32013,SUPPORT,The Chasm of the Bound?,
32013,SUPPORT,"I've never heard of it, but chances are it's some kind
of sacred artifact belonging to the church.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Huh. This is the first I've heard of it... So you believe
Abyss is connected to that place?",
32013,SUPPORT,"Lots of twists and turns down here, so it's not the
craziest idea ever. Must be well hidden though.",
32013,SUPPORT,"I once happened upon an old document that
mentioned a ritual called the Rite of Rising.",
32013,SUPPORT,"The text was incomplete, so I was unable to achieve
a full understanding of the topic. I cannot even
guarantee the authenticity of what I read.",
32013,SUPPORT,"But it stated that the Chalice of Beginnings is a
sacred object crafted by order of Saint Seiros herself.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Saint Seiros apparently used the artifact to carry out
the Rite of Rising, along with the Four Apostles.",
32013,SUPPORT,What is the Rite of Rising?,
32013,SUPPORT,Who are the Four Apostles?,
32013,SUPPORT,"It is a ritual that is believed to have the power to
resurrect a life that was lost.",
32013,SUPPORT,"I vaguely recall reading about the Four Apostles.
They were saints...and that's about all anyone knows.
Hardly any records of them remain.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Few alive even know their names, but these apostles
supposedly assisted the Four Saints with their
holy work.",
32013,SUPPORT,"It is also believed that Saint Seiros attempted to
perform a resurrection using the chalice.",
32013,SUPPORT,"However, the ritual failed... The Four Apostles
bound the chalice so that it would never fall into
a mortal's hands.",
32013,SUPPORT,"The Rite of Rising, eh? Hmm...",
32013,SUPPORT,"Ah, yes, the chalice of legend! My father mentioned
it to me a very long time ago.",
32013,SUPPORT,"A secret treasure of the church... A chalice powerful
enough to resurrect the dead... Exhilarating, no?",
32013,SUPPORT,Quite. It is no small wonder that people are after it.,
32013,SUPPORT,"Even so, we still don't have much to go on. We must
gather more information about this legend at once.",
32013,SUPPORT,"I wholeheartedly agree. I will do all I can to track
down more clues within the monastery.",
32013,SUPPORT,"Although, Garreg Mach's library is so...well curated,
I doubt any further records will be found.",
32013,SUPPORT,Wondrous! We shall do all that we can as well.,
32014,SUPPORT,"The answer is no. I will not allow it. It is far too
dangerous.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Ah, but if we can determine its origin, we may
eliminate the very danger that vexes you!",
32014,SUPPORT,"You already know this, but there are plenty of folks
down here who can't defend themselves.",
32014,SUPPORT,"If these attacks keep up, eventually they'll find
themselves in harm's way.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Yes, I am aware. However, for the time being, you
must promise to refrain from acting recklessly.",
32014,SUPPORT,"My dear flock has suffered enough as it is. You
needn't take any further risks.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Surprisingly overbearing, isn't he? He must really
care about you guys.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Most certainly. Yet if we fail to nip this problem in
the bud...I shudder to think what will transpire.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Aha, it's you! In the nick of time, as it were.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Come, let us venture into the deep, deep
underground. The chalice of legend awaits!",
32014,SUPPORT,We're going underground?,
32014,SUPPORT,The chalice...,
32014,SUPPORT,"But of course! Deeper and deeper still beneath the
monastery, to the Chasm of the Bound.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Aelfric told us all about it, and so we must locate this
mystical place and grab hold of the waiting prize!",
32014,SUPPORT,"Coco... You didn't hear a word Elfie said, did you?",
32014,SUPPORT,"I surely did, but we must read between the lines.
Aelfric wants a solution as badly as we do.",
32014,SUPPORT,"And so, we shall seek out the Chalice of Beginnings
and present it to the church!",
32014,SUPPORT,"If our enemies desire the object, this should halt all
future attacks on Abyss! Ahaha! Brilliant, no?",
32014,SUPPORT,"I'm not so sure about that. According to legend,
there's some kind of binding that protects it from
would-be thieves.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Even if we find it, we can't just walk up and take it
unless we figure out how to break that thing.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Ah, but that is simplicity itself! We shall first
ascertain whether it is still bound, and then...
we shall release it!",
32014,SUPPORT,"But where is this chasm, anyway? I've never even
heard of the place, much less seen it.",
32014,SUPPORT,"As luck would have it, I have discovered yet another
secret passage! It appears to go deep underground.",
32014,SUPPORT,"According to my superior instincts, it undoubtedly
leads to the Chasm of the Bound!",
32014,SUPPORT,Huh. I suppose it's worth a look.,
32014,SUPPORT,"I don't care about finding some old cup, but if it
could help us protect Abyss, I'll support the cause.",
32014,SUPPORT,"You surface dwellers do not have anything else to do
at present, do you? You'll assist us, will you not?",
32014,SUPPORT,We're busy. Very busy.,
32014,SUPPORT,We'll go with you.,
32014,SUPPORT,"Come on, Teach. We got plenty of time to follow
them down that deep, dark tunnel. Admit it.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Personally, I'm dying to find out more about this
chasm and chalice business.",
32014,SUPPORT,"I don't have anything scheduled before my next nap,
so I guess that's fine. Edelgard doesn't look too
thrilled, though...",
32014,SUPPORT,Ahaha! Splendid! It is decided. We leave at once.,
32014,SUPPORT,"Feeling pretty lost right now. How long have we
been walking? I'm guessing a full week.",
32014,SUPPORT,A week? Ridiculous. It's been a few hours at most.,
32014,SUPPORT,"Exaggerations aside, if this takes much longer,
I'm concerned about our lack of food and water.",
32014,SUPPORT,"She's got a point. How about we trek a bit farther,
and if we don't find anything, we turn back?",
32014,SUPPORT,"Constance... I find it rather curious how quickly you
became fixated on the chalice. Care to explain?",
32014,SUPPORT,"Oh, I... No. Why would I be fixated on a silly little
legend...for some supposed ulterior motive? Ahaha...",
32014,SUPPORT,"Ha, you want the esteem. You think this will
convince the church to help you restore your
fallen house.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Uh! How could you possibly know that?! Have you
been snooping within the confines of my very mind?!",
32014,SUPPORT,"""I shall restore House Nuvelle to its former glory
at all costs!"" Haha! It's practically your catchphrase.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Aha! Just as I suspected. Constance is the former
lady of House Nuvelle.",
32014,SUPPORT,What is House Nuvelle?,
32014,SUPPORT,You know House Nuvelle?,
32014,SUPPORT,"Until just a few years ago, it was a house of viscounts
in the west of the Empire. They had a long and
distinguished history.",
32014,SUPPORT,"In a sense. Until just a few years ago, it was a house
of viscounts in the west of the Empire.",
32014,SUPPORT,"House Nuvelle lost its status five years ago, as a
result of their part in the war.",
32014,SUPPORT,"Huh. You speak as though it has nothing to do
with you.",
32014,SUPPORT,"I fear all I can do is ask forgiveness in place of my
useless father.",
32014,SUPPORT,"If doing so will comfort you in any way, then please
accept my—",
32014,SUPPORT,"Save your breath. That will not be necessary. There
is only one thing that I desire.",
32014,SUPPORT,"For the sake of my parents...who fell courageously
and selflessly in defense of the Empire...",
32014,SUPPORT,"For them, I shall restore our status, revive House
Nuvelle, and return it to its former glory!",
32014,SUPPORT,"All that I do, even spending each day advancing
my magical prowess, is to that end.",
32014,SUPPORT,"And in reward for all that hard work, you were
forced to live underground. Life's cruel.",
32014,SUPPORT,"It's like you took a shortcut back to the starting line.
Or maybe you're just unlucky.",
32014,SUPPORT,"What are you saying?! I never intended to share...
that side of me with you...",
32014,SUPPORT,"Look at that! It's a good thing we didn't turn back.
That looks mighty chasm-like if you ask me.",
32015,SUPPORT,"Say... Are we beneath the bridge at the monastery?
Incredible...",
32015,SUPPORT,"Huh. I never thought I'd be gazing up at that bridge
we've crossed a thousand times from way, way
down below.",
32015,SUPPORT,Are we sure this is the right place?,
32015,SUPPORT,It is. I think. I believe. I...hope?,
32015,SUPPORT,"Constance, why are you hiding in the shade? Aren't
you the one who insisted that we find the chalice?",
32015,SUPPORT,"Fine! If you insist that I join you, then I shall.
Satisfied?!",
32015,SUPPORT,...,
32015,SUPPORT,"Oh my. I was quite rude just now... Please accept my
humble apologies for treating you so foully.",
32015,SUPPORT,"I presumed too much to stand beside such noble
paragons. Allow me to dig a hole to bury myself in...",
32015,SUPPORT,"Ugh... No matter how deep underground we are,
I guess sunlight is still sunlight. Poor Constance.",
32015,SUPPORT,What's going on?,
32015,SUPPORT,She's not her usual self...,
32015,SUPPORT,"This is what Coco's like in the sun. That's why she
lives underground.",
32015,SUPPORT,"I fear I cannot guarantee that this is the Chasm of
the Bound. I have almost surely wasted our time.",
32015,SUPPORT,"Enough with the self-doubt, yeah? Just put one foot
in front of the other. We'll have you back in the
shadows before you know it.",
32015,SUPPORT,"Cheer up, Coco. We need you.",
32015,SUPPORT,"And now I have forced you into a state of pity. I feel
so very worthless.",
32015,SUPPORT,"I admit, I have never seen anything quite like this
before. Is there nothing we can do to help?",
32015,SUPPORT,"Hapi, keep Constance moving. If we don't start
searching, we'll never find that damn chalice.",
32015,SUPPORT,"Fine. I'll just push her a bit, I guess...",
32015,SUPPORT,"I must ask you to cease. You shall soil your hands
upon my filthy back. No soap could possibly— Huh?",
32015,SUPPORT,"This feeling... I sense magic in the air. There is
something just ahead. The binding spell, perhaps...",
32015,SUPPORT,"I don't feel anything at all... Wait. Actually, I hear
something. Something big. And it's moving.",
32015,SUPPORT,"Perhaps there is something in place that is guarding
the chalice.",
32015,SUPPORT,"Yikes! What is that thing? It's like some kind of
gigantic toy.",
32015,SUPPORT,"I don't have the slightest idea what's going on,
but I know it doesn't bode well.",
32015,SUPPORT,"I dunno. Could be fun. It's been a while since I've
met an enemy that could put up a good fight!",
32015,SUPPORT,"Hey, you! Meet your master, pal! I'm gonna pummel
you into my own personal shield!",
32016,SUPPORT,Look! There's something in that opening!,
32016,SUPPORT,Oh! Can it be?,
32016,SUPPORT,Is that...,
32016,SUPPORT,"You would know best. It is beyond my ken whether
that is the chalice. Curse my ignorance!",
32016,SUPPORT,"Answer the question, will ya? Is it or isn't it?",
32016,SUPPORT,"That quaking earlier... Some kind of containment
magic related to the Crests was in place here.",
32016,SUPPORT,"Whether intentionally or not, the chalice was
released. I hesitate to suggest that those things were
the cause.",
32016,SUPPORT,"Oh, perhaps one of our Crests was the key to
unbinding the chalice...",
32016,SUPPORT,Care to summarize that?,
32016,SUPPORT,"My apologies. I have caused you undue vexation by
speaking so incomprehensibly.",
32016,SUPPORT,"Were I to venture a tentative guess, I would say that
this is, indeed, the Chalice of Beginnings.",
32016,SUPPORT,"You could have just said, ""This is it, all right!""",
32016,SUPPORT,"Forgotten Crests resembling those of the Four
Apostles, depicted on a sealed rock wall...",
32016,SUPPORT,"Objects that resemble holy armaments and a chalice
that gathers magic all on its own...",
32016,SUPPORT,"I don't know of any other legends that cover all of
that, so this must be the chalice we're looking for.",
32016,SUPPORT,"A thousand thank-yous for covering my own
inadequacy with such a competent explanation.",
32016,SUPPORT,"I'm still not used to hearing you speak in such
a manner...",
32016,SUPPORT,"Forgive me, Your Highness. If I have displeased you,
please take my life as a small gesture of atonement.",
32016,SUPPORT,"Oh, Your Highest of Highnesses, I doth humbly beg
of thee to find forgiveness within your royal heart.",
32016,SUPPORT,"Stop fooling around, Claude. And, Constance,
I assure you, there is nothing to forgive.",
32016,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32016,SUPPORT,I hear thunder. Rain is soon to follow.,
32016,SUPPORT,"We'd better head back to Abyss before the storm
hits us.",
32016,SUPPORT,...,
32016,SUPPORT,"Ugh! It happened yet again. Why must my good
intentions always—",
32016,SUPPORT,Huh? What was that sound?! It cannot be...,
32017,SUPPORT,"Oh, my poor, abused legs! I have been remiss to
neglect my lower...body exercise as of late...",
32017,SUPPORT,"Don't give up—we're almost back to Abyss!
What a damn mess we've gotten ourselves into...",
32017,SUPPORT,"We should give up. Just throw the chalice at the
big one and be done with it. It doesn't seem like
they're gonna ease off.",
32017,SUPPORT,"If that doesn't work, I guess we're dead.",
32017,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! I think not! I shall never surrender! I shall
not die until I have achieved my glorious aim!",
32017,SUPPORT,"For crying out loud... Those creepy toy things must
love a good chase. They won't let up!",
32017,SUPPORT,"Not to mention the enemies that look like phantoms.
Further measures to protect the chalice, I'm sure.",
32017,SUPPORT,"Maybe Hapi's right, and this won't stop so long as
we have the artifact.",
32017,SUPPORT,"We can't lead them back to Abyss, or the people
there will be in danger!",
32017,SUPPORT,Let's fight them.,
32017,SUPPORT,There's nothing we can do.,
32017,SUPPORT,Let's give it back.,
32017,SUPPORT,"Agreed. But first, let's run just a bit farther. I know a
good place to keep the enemy at bay.",
32017,SUPPORT,"Are you daft, or is this a test? We obviously need
to lead our enemy somewhere that gives us the
advantage and then face them head on!",
32017,SUPPORT,"Good call. Are you OK with that, Yuri-bird?",
32017,SUPPORT,"Of course not. Let's keep running just a bit longer.
I know a good place to keep the enemy at bay.",
32017,SUPPORT,"Oh yeah! The gates! They're so damn sturdy
I nearly broke my priceless fist on one once.",
32017,SUPPORT,"You punched one? Like a brute?! Ugh! Why must
you always behave in such an infantile manner?",
32017,SUPPORT,"He probably thought that was the best way to test its
sturdiness. He doesn't have bad intentions, he's just
that dumb.",
32017,SUPPORT,"Balthus. If you broke the mechanism, I'm sacrificing
you to the creepy doll.",
32018,SUPPORT,"Well, that was awful. I'm never going back down
there, that's for damn sure.",
32018,SUPPORT,"Ha! With things like that wandering around,
you couldn't even if you wanted to.",
32018,SUPPORT,It was a valuable learning experience.,
32018,SUPPORT,I was pretty sure we were going to die.,
32018,SUPPORT,"Aren't you optimistic. There were a few times I was
sure we were done for.",
32018,SUPPORT,"Not sure I believe you. You were pretty calm
that whole time.",
32018,SUPPORT,"Has Aelfric yet returned? We must present the
chalice to the church at once!",
32018,SUPPORT,"You! You're all safe! How could you sneak off at a
time like this?!",
32018,SUPPORT,Did something happen?,
32018,SUPPORT,We had some underground business to attend to.,
32018,SUPPORT,"Underground? But we are underground! Anyway,
things are bad! Really bad!",
32018,SUPPORT,"Some strangers from the outside have kidnapped
Master Aelfric!",
32018,SUPPORT,Aelfric? No! It cannot be true!,
32018,SUPPORT,"It happened as soon as he returned from the
monastery. Bandits were lying in wait.",
32018,SUPPORT,Dammit! How could this happen?!,
32018,SUPPORT,"This was clearly premeditated. I am certain it is
connected to the bandits we fended off earlier.",
32018,SUPPORT,Have you alerted the church?,
32018,SUPPORT,Not yet. It all happened so suddenly...,
32018,SUPPORT,"Do you think we should? Can we trust them? If we
cause too much trouble, Abyss is doomed...",
32018,SUPPORT,"Now isn't the time to worry about that! We're in no
position to cover something like this up.",
32018,SUPPORT,"The church has eyes and ears everywhere, so they
may already know what's going on. Either way,
go and tell them the news. Now.",
32018,SUPPORT,Sure thing! Understood!,
32018,SUPPORT,"Also, if anyone was wounded, send them here.
We'll patch them up with healing magic.",
32018,SUPPORT,Wait... Where's Hapi? And Linhardt?,
32018,SUPPORT,"Hapi! Wherever did you disappear to! Aelfric has
been—",
32018,SUPPORT,I know. Take a look at this.,
32018,SUPPORT,What's that? Looks like some kind of fancy letter.,
32018,SUPPORT,That's because it is. It was lying in the classroom.,
32018,SUPPORT,"""We have abducted Cardinal Aelfric. We can
guarantee his safety, for now.",
32018,SUPPORT,"""If you want to help him, meet us tomorrow evening
in the ruins of the old chapel. Bring the chalice.",
32018,SUPPORT,"""Know that if you alert the knights, the cardinal's life
will be forfeit.""",
32018,SUPPORT,Could it be...,
32018,SUPPORT,"No doubt about it. This letter must have been left by
the people who abducted Aelfric.",
32018,SUPPORT,"Then our enemy really is after the chalice. All the
while, they were waiting for us to locate it for them.",
32018,SUPPORT,No... No! Something about this does not ring true!,
32018,SUPPORT,"None of it rings true, so which part in particular are
you talking about?",
32018,SUPPORT,"How did the enemy know that we were searching
for the chalice to begin with?",
32018,SUPPORT,This can only mean that someone in Abyss is—,
32018,SUPPORT,"You smell a rat. Someone who notified the church
of our plan.",
32018,SUPPORT,"It's no good talking about theoretical rats right now.
First we have to deal with the problem at hand.",
32018,SUPPORT,Too true. For once you are speaking reasonably.,
32019,SUPPORT,"We really lucked out there. Fewer injuries than
I would have expected...and most were minor.",
32019,SUPPORT,"I suppose the only conclusion we can draw is that
they really were after Aelfric all this time...",
32019,SUPPORT,"Perhaps they were instructed to avoid
unnecessary casualties...",
32019,SUPPORT,"Is that Aelfric guy really a cardinal? Are the secret
cardinals really a thing? I thought that was a myth.",
32019,SUPPORT,"Hard to believe. Did you folks in the Ashen Wolves
know that?",
32019,SUPPORT,"Nah, that's news to me. The identity of the cardinals
is top secret, even within the church.",
32019,SUPPORT,"He never would have told us something like that.
Oh, except maybe Yuri...",
32019,SUPPORT,He and I talk about a lot of things.,
32019,SUPPORT,"But right now, I'd say we have more important topics
to discuss than his title.",
32019,SUPPORT,"Aelfric's been kidnapped. What are we going to do
about it?",
32019,SUPPORT,"Even if it is in the name of rescuing him, we simply
cannot hand over the chalice to those scoundrels!",
32019,SUPPORT,Let's just give them the thing and be done with it.,
32019,SUPPORT,"Professor! I came as fast as I could when I heard
the report. I had no idea you'd be here!",
32019,SUPPORT,"Is this loud...uh, excitable knight a friend of yours?",
32019,SUPPORT,He's a friend of my father's.,
32019,SUPPORT,He's a trusted friend.,
32019,SUPPORT,I don't know this man.,
32019,SUPPORT,"Precisely so! I'm Alois, right-hand man to the former
captain of the Knights of Seiros, Jeralt!",
32019,SUPPORT,"Oh my. That means our professor here is the child of
a captain!",
32019,SUPPORT,"You humble me, Professor! I'm Alois. I serve the
church as a knight of Seiros.",
32019,SUPPORT,"Professor! I love a good joke myself, but that one
was rather cruel, don't you think?",
32019,SUPPORT,"Now, about Aelfric's kidnapping...",
32019,SUPPORT,"Since he's an important member of the church,
we must use any means necessary to find him.",
32019,SUPPORT,"That said...most of the holy knights have been
deployed to deal with the Western Church.",
32019,SUPPORT,"Sure, but any knights are better than no knights,
yeah?",
32019,SUPPORT,"I like your attitude, though I'm still embarrassed
that we're not in full force... But hey, at least we're
quite forceful!",
32019,SUPPORT,"Ugh. Here, take this letter. We believe it was left
by whoever kidnapped the cardinal.",
32019,SUPPORT,"In it, the enemy clearly spells out their plan. They're
after a chalice that was hidden beneath Abyss.",
32019,SUPPORT,"A chalice, hm? A chalice... Hmmm... Ah! Do you
mean THE chalice?!",
32019,SUPPORT,"But no, why would it be there? I've never heard
anything about it being stowed away in Abyss.",
32019,SUPPORT,"Then this is gonna come as a shock, pal.",
32019,SUPPORT,"What in the goddess's name?! Is that really the
chalice from the legends?!",
32019,SUPPORT,"The probability of that is unassailably high, yes.",
32019,SUPPORT,"It was guarded by a bunch of giant, creepy toys. 
There was powerful magic protecting it and
everything.",
32019,SUPPORT,Please believe us.,
32019,SUPPORT,I saw it with my own eyes.,
32019,SUPPORT,"If you say so. Wow, that means the story about the
chalice being bound was true.",
32019,SUPPORT,"Well, what's done is done! Oh, but I guess it's not
done just yet.",
32019,SUPPORT,I must report this to Lady Rhea at once!,
32020,SUPPORT,So that is what transpired...,
32020,SUPPORT,"This is, indeed, the Chalice of Beginnings. It matches
the descriptions in the few records of it that remain.",
32020,SUPPORT,Don't beat around the bush. What's our punishment?,
32020,SUPPORT,"You removed a most sacred treasure. Truly it is
my obligation to mete out punishment for that
transgression. However...",
32020,SUPPORT,"You also helped the church locate a valuable artifact.
In light of this good deed, I shall forgive the bad one.",
32020,SUPPORT,I do wonder...,
32020,SUPPORT,What's on your mind?,
32020,SUPPORT,"I am wondering whether your presence had anything
to do with the artifact's unbinding, Professor.",
32020,SUPPORT,"As per the church chronicles, the Four Apostles
secured the chalice with powerful magic.",
32020,SUPPORT,"The only way to release the chalice is by using the
four Crests passed down through their bloodlines.",
32020,SUPPORT,"However, given the special power you possess,
perhaps you were able to unlock it yourself.",
32020,SUPPORT,"There is no knowing at present. For the time being,
I will keep the chalice somewhere safe.",
32020,SUPPORT,"As for Aelfric, I assure you that the knights will find
and return him in due time.",
32020,SUPPORT,"I consider him to be one of my many children,
after all. I will not allow harm to befall him.",
32020,SUPPORT,"Lady Rhea, might I ask a moment of your time?
We cannot be expected to give up our endeavor!",
32020,SUPPORT,"The enemy stated most clearly that if the knights
are involved, our dear Aelfric is finished!",
32020,SUPPORT,"We owe him so much. If there is any possibility that
his life is in danger, the risk is too great to chance!",
32020,SUPPORT,"True. The knights are strong and all, but they're
liable to get him killed.",
32020,SUPPORT,We can take care of it. With Chatterbox's help.,
32020,SUPPORT,"Our professor has the strength of a hundred knights,
or about one and a half of me. We've got this.
How about it, Rhea?",
32020,SUPPORT,"We've been through too damned much to get here.
Leave the chalice and Aelfric to us. You won't
regret it.",
32020,SUPPORT,Lady Rhea... Please.,
32020,SUPPORT,Hmm...,
32020,SUPPORT,Give them a shot.,
32020,SUPPORT,I'll take full responsibility.,
32020,SUPPORT,"If you consent to join your power with theirs...
Yes, perhaps there is hope.",
32020,SUPPORT,"If you join your power with theirs... Yes, perhaps
there is hope.",
32020,SUPPORT,As you wish. I shall entrust you with the chalice.,
32020,SUPPORT,"Your Grace, the chalice is a legendary treasure!",
32020,SUPPORT,You can't just hand it over to those underground—,
32020,SUPPORT,"That is quite enough. There is no cause to worry,
I assure you. There will be no further discussion on
the matter.",
32020,SUPPORT,"Even if we lost hold of the chalice, it would be
impossible for the thieves to make use of it.",
32020,SUPPORT,"Though it was created to return a life that was lost,
I doubt that anyone alive knows how to accomplish
that feat.",
32020,SUPPORT,"If someone were to successfully replicate the ritual...
it would perhaps be the work of fate.",
32021,SUPPORT,"Your Grace, please reconsider.",
32021,SUPPORT,"The chalice is among the church's greatest treasures,
akin to even the Heroes' Relics.",
32021,SUPPORT,"I am well aware, which is why I have already dealt
with the matter.",
32021,SUPPORT,"Consider this, the Heroes' Relics are fearsome
weapons imbued with great power.",
32021,SUPPORT,"On the contrary, the chalice has long lost the power
it once possessed. It is little more than a token of
history.",
32021,SUPPORT,"If that is so, then why is it still considered such an
important artifact?",
32021,SUPPORT,"It was created for a sacred purpose. To use the blood
of the Four Apostles to...return the goddess to our
world.",
32021,SUPPORT,Their blood...,
32021,SUPPORT,Your Grace? Is something the matter?,
32021,SUPPORT,"I have an urgent mission for you. Investigate the
origins of the Ashen Wolves.",
32021,SUPPORT,"Start with their enrollment forms for the academy.
Keep an eye out for falsified documents.",
32021,SUPPORT,"Yes, of course. Understood.",
32021,SUPPORT,"Before you begin, summon Alois at once. I have new
orders for the knights as well.",
32021,SUPPORT,"As you wish, Your Grace.",
32021,SUPPORT,"If I am correct, we haven't a moment to lose. 
Another tragedy is soon to transpire...",
32022,SUPPORT,"Hey, Boss. Been meaning to ask—how'd you end up
down here in Abyss?",
32022,SUPPORT,"What is this, some sort of interrogation?",
32022,SUPPORT,"Yeah, you've never been big on sharing. I mean, you
know all about me, and there's still so much I don't
know about you.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Look, I get it. Talking about the past isn't easy.
But I'm curious, yeah? So get to it. I've got all day.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Do you now? Heh heh. Well. I guess now's as good a
time as any to tell you.",
32022,SUPPORT,"I'm here because I killed some people from
the church.",
32022,SUPPORT,That cannot be!,
32022,SUPPORT,What do you mean by that?,
32022,SUPPORT,You have a grudge against the church?,
32022,SUPPORT,"Of course I don't. What kind of person do you think
I am? Someone who'd willingly kill others?",
32022,SUPPORT,"Originally, I attended the academy as Count Rowe's
adopted kid.",
32022,SUPPORT,"There came a point when the church ordered me to
wipe out some members from my old gang. Told me
it was part of some important mission.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Who is this ""old gang"" you speak of?",
32022,SUPPORT,"They were nothing more than common thieves to
someone like you, Constance.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Anyway, they're like family to me, so naturally I
protested my orders. Things got pretty heated and,
well...the rest is history.",
32022,SUPPORT,"That's some story, pal. You're damn lucky they
didn't execute you.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Heh, you're telling me. Aelfric stepped in and
implored them to spare my life, told them to
consider the circumstances.",
32022,SUPPORT,"It's not so different for the rest of you. I'm sure he
helped all of us out in different ways.",
32022,SUPPORT,"He did. I was about to be thrown in the monastery's
underground jail...",
32022,SUPPORT,"People thought I was dangerous, what with my
""gift"" and all.",
32022,SUPPORT,"It's dark and dingy here, but it sure beats a prison
cell. Elfie really saved my neck.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Back to the point—Balthus, what was it you were so
curious about?",
32022,SUPPORT,"You had ideas regarding why our enemies may be
clawing after the chalice, perhaps?",
32022,SUPPORT,"Nah, nothing like that. But I am hung up on
something Rhea said.",
32022,SUPPORT,"That binding on the chalice was linked to the Four
Apostles, yeah? I know I've got Chevalier's—",
32022,SUPPORT,"Sorry, but mind if I cut in?",
32022,SUPPORT,What is it? Can't you see we're busy?,
32022,SUPPORT,"I can. But I just remembered something. Something
important. Specifically, the names of the Apostles.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Aubin, Chevalier, Noa, and Timotheos. The four
apostles whose bloodlines were lost to time.",
32022,SUPPORT,"I figured the Ashen Wolves might have thoughts
about all that.",
32022,SUPPORT,Uh... Mm...,
32022,SUPPORT,"No use hiding it now, Constance. Let's lay all of our
cards on the table. As for me, I've got the Major
Crest of Chevalier.",
32022,SUPPORT,"When I enrolled at the academy, the church ordered
me to keep that tidbit to myself. So I did.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Mm-hm. And I've got the Major Crest of Aubin.
Never did sort out how it is I have this thing.",
32022,SUPPORT,"As for me, the blood of Saint Noa courses through
my veins. This is kept hidden, even from the Empire.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Which probably means mine's from Timotheos. I do
have a vague recollection of being told my Crest is
rare.",
32022,SUPPORT,"So the four Crests, which were presumed lost, have
all been gathered into the same house.",
32022,SUPPORT,"All thanks to our buddy Aelfric, it would seem.",
32022,SUPPORT,"And now Aelfric has been abducted. Why could
that be?",
32022,SUPPORT,"If it was the chalice they were after, they could have
stolen it from us without the need for anything sly.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Maybe someone had it out for him. Or maybe he
messed around with the wrong people.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Or it could just be unrelated entirely. We're trying
to untangle this mess by tying more knots into it.",
32022,SUPPORT,"I mean, Balthus, you landed here on accident, didn't
you? It's not like that's linked to the rest of us.",
32022,SUPPORT,"And I could just as easily have never ended up down
here, you know? You're jumping at shadows.",
32022,SUPPORT,"Anyway, we don't have time for this. Let's get our
act together and head to the chapel ruins.",
32023,SUPPORT,"Hey, friend.",
32023,SUPPORT,"Let's not deny that there's a connection between us.
How about you and me have ourselves a little date,
huh?",
32023,SUPPORT,You want to take me on a...date?,
32023,SUPPORT,Now is not the time.,
32023,SUPPORT,You're smiling with your mouth but not your eyes...,
32023,SUPPORT,"Sure it is. With my heart full from a nice date, I'll be
poised to fight with extra vigor in the next battle.",
32023,SUPPORT,Ha! It only happens when I'm being a little greedy.,
32023,SUPPORT,"When the bell strikes midnight, meet me out front
of the Holy Mausoleum.",
32023,SUPPORT,"My only condition is that you arrive promptly after
midnight—and not a moment before. What say you?",
32023,SUPPORT,Isn't it forbidden to enter the Holy Mausoleum?,
32023,SUPPORT,Why at such a late hour?,
32023,SUPPORT,All will be revealed when you arrive.,
32023,SUPPORT,"It's the most romantic time of the evening of course!
Or is the idea of a date with me not appealing
to you? Heh heh...",
32023,SUPPORT,"Nobles have nearly killed one another fighting for
my affections, you know.",
32023,SUPPORT,"Perhaps you won't get all you want out of me, heh,
but I'll promise you a fun time regardless.",
32023,SUPPORT,"It's settled. I'll see you tomorrow night, friend.
Don't stand me up.",
32024,SUPPORT,That crumbly old chapel somewhere nearby or what?,
32024,SUPPORT,"I can play little part here, save perhaps as a
bargaining chip for our dear Aelfric...",
32024,SUPPORT,"Getting yourself captured instead? That wouldn't be
good at all, Constance!",
32024,SUPPORT,"I think we should be more worried about B's...
appearance. I mean, he's got way, WAY more,
uh...life experience than the rest of us.",
32024,SUPPORT,"And all that life experience makes you look more
like a knight than a student, B.",
32024,SUPPORT,"You saying I'm old, pal? Don't forget you're speaking
to the Ageless King of Grappling.",
32024,SUPPORT,"She's not wrong, Baltie. There's a pretty big age gap
between you two.",
32024,SUPPORT,"You're friends with Hilda's older brother, right?
That explains your...maturity. You make Hubert
look like a spring chicken.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Can it, will ya? Anyway, I'm wearing a school
uniform. No way in hell they'll think I'm a knight.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Yeah, and anyone wearing a school uniform is
without a doubt a student.",
32024,SUPPORT,"To be honest, for a good while, I actually did think
you might be a knight...",
32024,SUPPORT,"Who made your uniforms and set up the Ashen Wolf
House, anyhow?",
32024,SUPPORT,"If I might so humbly interject, that would be Aelfric.",
32024,SUPPORT,"He pulled everything together for us...some time
after he was appointed as the guardian of Abyss.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Said he wanted to give former students who were
expelled from the academy somewhere to live.
Somewhere to belong.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Of course, all of this was established long before any
of us were in the picture.",
32024,SUPPORT,Seems like he really cares about people.,
32024,SUPPORT,So getting you four together was a coincidence?,
32024,SUPPORT,"It does. Whatever his aims, it seems he has quite a
few noble qualities.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Perhaps. After hearing all of that, it's not as
unbelievable as I'd thought.",
32024,SUPPORT,"All I know is that he helped me, so I'll help him.",
32024,SUPPORT,"I strongly doubt that I shall factor into Aelfric's
retrieval, but I shall follow your lead.",
32024,SUPPORT,"There it is. We owe Aelfric. Maybe your goddess
doesn't care about debts, but my fists and I sure do.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Sorry to have roped you into all this, friend.",
32024,SUPPORT,I don't mind.,
32024,SUPPORT,If it's for my students...,
32024,SUPPORT,"We owe you. Just stick with us a bit longer,
won't you?",
32024,SUPPORT,"What a pal! The Ashen Wolves really landed an A+
professor. Not just on paper, but in practice too.",
32024,SUPPORT,"This is great! Has me ready to get to it and start
hitting things.",
32024,SUPPORT,What's up?,
32024,SUPPORT,Scared?,
32024,SUPPORT,How cheeky. Me? Never. Although...,
32024,SUPPORT,"Ever since I was a kid, I've lived my life by one
rule—that I'd only play my hand if I was guaranteed
victory.",
32024,SUPPORT,"I've gotten this far by using my cunning in any way
necessary—lying, cheating, even killing when there
was no other way...",
32024,SUPPORT,"But this next play? Well, the odds don't exactly seem
to be in my favor.",
32024,SUPPORT,"Not unless you trust me enough to provide me with
an ace...",
32024,SUPPORT,"Heh. Never you mind, friend. Let's just go.",
32025,SUPPORT,"Ha ha ha! At last you've arrived! You certainly took
your sweet time...",
32025,SUPPORT,My flock! Why have you come?!,
32025,SUPPORT,"To save you of course. You didn't really think we'd
just up and abandon you, did ya?",
32025,SUPPORT,"If I may be so bold, we have the chalice you seek.
Might I humbly request that you return Aelfric?",
32025,SUPPORT,"You found the chalice? When I told you of it, I never
imagined you'd—",
32025,SUPPORT,"Let's make sure it's not some cheap imitation.
Hand it over.",
32025,SUPPORT,"Not until you hand over the hostage. There needs to
be some degree of a trusting exchange here.",
32025,SUPPORT,"I can see you don't understand your own
predicament.",
32025,SUPPORT,"We've no issue killing the lot of you and taking it
either way.",
32025,SUPPORT,"I can't tell if this guy's ears are stuffed with wool or
if he's just this stupid.",
32025,SUPPORT,"Can't say I'm surprised. Thugs like this aren't about
to show us any gesture of sincerity.",
32025,SUPPORT,Yuri! Stand down!,
32025,SUPPORT,Leave me! Take the chalice and flee—you must!,
32025,SUPPORT,"It is irreplaceable—you must not hand it to these
brigands!",
32025,SUPPORT,"Heh. You know us better than that. We didn't come
here without a plan. Do your thing, Hapi!",
32025,SUPPORT,Wait— Do what thing?,
32025,SUPPORT,Seriously? Right now?,
32025,SUPPORT,Uh...,
32025,SUPPORT,"Now, Hapi!",
32025,SUPPORT,Fine. Fine. Fine. *siiiiiiigh*,
32025,SUPPORT,Her sigh! She—,
32025,SUPPORT,Crawwwwww!,
32025,SUPPORT,"I've gotta say, that sigh of hers never gets old.",
32025,SUPPORT,"Yeah, yeah, glad you like the show. It's not like it's
a gift I asked for.",
32025,SUPPORT,Gyah! Where did that thing come from?!,
32025,SUPPORT,"Hahaha! Absolute cowards! How entertaining.
Balthus, will you do the honors?",
32025,SUPPORT,"Leave it to me, Boss! I got—DAMN! Argh!",
32025,SUPPORT,Crawwwwww!,
32025,SUPPORT,"Hey, Balthus, quit screwing around! Oh...wow. It
flew off with him.",
32025,SUPPORT,"He'll sort it out. At least we got Aelfric back in one
piece. Now, to handle these fools.",
32025,SUPPORT,"Cheap party tricks! Let's make these children
scream!",
32026,SUPPORT,Yuri! You damned scoundrel! What are you doing?!,
32026,SUPPORT,"Heh, I think you can see what I'm doing, Balthus.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Beautifully executed, Yuri. The chalice is finally
mine now.",
32026,SUPPORT,Along with the blood of the Four Apostles.,
32026,SUPPORT,"It seems I was correct...that there was an enemy in
our midst. To think our bird was instead a rat.",
32026,SUPPORT,"You've always had a wild imagination, Constance.
I've got to say, turning your attention elsewhere was
a challenge even for me.",
32026,SUPPORT,"That is enough with the banter, Yuri. I informed you
not to divulge too much.",
32026,SUPPORT,"They'll all be under the dirt soon enough. It's not
like they'll be able to talk at that point.",
32026,SUPPORT,"After all I've gone and done for you, Aelfric, I would
think you'd have just a bit more faith in me.",
32026,SUPPORT,...,
32026,SUPPORT,"Your silence speaks volumes... Guess this is the end
of the niceties.",
32026,SUPPORT,"It's all on you now, friend. I'm sure you and the
others will figure it out.",
32026,SUPPORT,Professor! Are you injured?,
32026,SUPPORT,I made it out unscathed.,
32026,SUPPORT,It's nothing too concerning...,
32026,SUPPORT,Impossible. Surely you suffered a wound.,
32026,SUPPORT,"I see you're well enough to make light of a serious
situation. But surely you suffered a wound.",
32026,SUPPORT,I didn't.,
32026,SUPPORT,"Teach, there's no time for playing around. Tell us
how— Ah, I get it. He only pretended to attack you,
didn't he?",
32026,SUPPORT,"So you were just playing a part in this grand
performance. But was that really the smartest
decision here?",
32026,SUPPORT,"The chalice and the Ashen Wolves are gone. I am
loath to think what will become of them without
our help.",
32026,SUPPORT,"And how do you propose we pursue them?
We haven't a clue where they went.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Well, we know what they're after. That at least
narrows down the possibilities.",
32026,SUPPORT,Professor! Are we too late?,
32026,SUPPORT,Lady Rhea? Why have you come?,
32026,SUPPORT,"After sending all of you off, I began to investigate
the lineage of the Ashen Wolves.",
32026,SUPPORT,"In doing so, I was able to confirm that the
documented information about their Crests
was falsified.",
32026,SUPPORT,"What was once a wild speculation, I now know to
be true.",
32026,SUPPORT,"The Crests they bear are the same as those of the
Four Apostles—the very same who long ago enacted
the Rite of Rising.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Once the blood of the four is poured upon the
chalice, its power can be harnessed.",
32026,SUPPORT,"I believe we have enough evidence to assume that
our Ashen Wolves will suffice to carry out this ritual.",
32026,SUPPORT,"So Aelfric's aim must be to carry out the Rite of
Rising...at the expense of the students...",
32026,SUPPORT,"Lady Rhea... What, precisely, is the purpose of
this ritual?",
32026,SUPPORT,"We've heard it has the power to resurrect life, but
that can't be true... Can it?",
32026,SUPPORT,"The chalice is a holy artifact, created by the goddess
herself. It serves to restore a physical form that was
previously lost to this world.",
32026,SUPPORT,"So those wild tales are true. It really can bring
someone back to life.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Not exactly. It can breathe life into a body, but it
cannot return a spirit that has already departed.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Ultimately, it is a tool to return the goddess to her
physical form. Her spirit is omnipresent, but her
flesh is no more.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Such incredible power is truly awe inspiring—and
extremely dangerous. In that way, it is akin to the
Heroes' Relics.",
32026,SUPPORT,"For this reason, the Four Apostles were never
intended to pass down their Crests. This gathering
should never have been possible.",
32026,SUPPORT,"The Ashen Wolves are now gathered together,
making it possible once more.",
32026,SUPPORT,"And Aelfric is at the center of this mess, luring them
all to Abyss for his own selfish reasons.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Without so much as a whisper of it to the church,
of course.",
32026,SUPPORT,"This incident is my own doing. I never should have
entrusted the chalice to them.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Lady Rhea, do you have any idea where they could
have gone?",
32026,SUPPORT,"I do indeed. Garreg Mach, which is protected by the
goddess, is the only place the Rite of Rising can
be performed.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Holding such a ritual requires absolute focus,
so I imagine the setting would need to be
serene, peaceful.",
32026,SUPPORT,"There are countless such places within the
monastery walls...",
32026,SUPPORT,The Holy Mausoleum?,
32026,SUPPORT,The dining hall?,
32026,SUPPORT,The library?,
32026,SUPPORT,"It's certainly peaceful there, but due to last month's
incident, it's heavily guarded at present.",
32026,SUPPORT,"I hardly think the dining hall would be considered
peaceful, Professor. Are you sure you're not
just hungry?",
32026,SUPPORT,"I suppose it's quiet there, but it's also open to the
public and just a wee bit cramped, Teach.",
32026,SUPPORT,"For now, let us return to the monastery. There is
much to consider.",
32026,SUPPORT,Lady Rhea!,
32026,SUPPORT,"You look troubled, Alois. What has happened?",
32026,SUPPORT,Thieves have breached Garreg Mach's village walls!,
32026,SUPPORT,"They've been pillaging the shops and residences,
taking whatever they please!",
32026,SUPPORT,I wonder if this has anything to do with Aelfric.,
32026,SUPPORT,"There's no telling, but for now, their numbers are
too great. They need the knights!",
32026,SUPPORT,"By your will, Lady Rhea, allow us to clear the village
of these hooligans!",
32026,SUPPORT,"Yes, Alois. Please ensure the safety of the villagers
immediately. However, leave a few of your best
knights here with me.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Yes, Your Grace. I'll see to it.",
32026,SUPPORT,Teach? You look like you've got something to say.,
32026,SUPPORT,I do. It's about Yuri...,
32026,SUPPORT,"He told you to meet up with him at the Holy
Mausoleum? You never run out of secrets, do
ya, Teach?",
32026,SUPPORT,"I'm certain that Yuri had his reasons for setting up
this meeting.",
32026,SUPPORT,"He took the time to speak with you, however
cryptically, before he left.",
32026,SUPPORT,"Fair point, Dimitri. I do wonder why he told you it
needed to be after midnight. Wouldn't it be better
to rush to their aid immediately?",
32026,SUPPORT,Yuri's no fool. There's a method to his madness...,
32027,SUPPORT,Where the heck are we?,
32027,SUPPORT,"Finally, you're all awake. Good morning,
sleepyheads. Or is it a good evening?",
32027,SUPPORT,"Yuri! You scoundrel! You are unfit to speak to us,
liar that you are!",
32027,SUPPORT,"Yeah, yeah, liar, blah-blah. Nothing I haven't
heard before.",
32027,SUPPORT,"Look, pal. Enough beating around the bush.
What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?",
32027,SUPPORT,Where's Aelfric? And what the hell are you plotting?,
32027,SUPPORT,"Questions, questions. You're wearing me out,
Balthus. Fine, then. I'll lay it out for you.",
32027,SUPPORT,Aelfric intends to reenact the Rite of Rising.,
32027,SUPPORT,He's preparing everything as we speak.,
32027,SUPPORT,"What is this silly rite, anyway? He trying to do some
crazy magic to raise the dead or something?",
32027,SUPPORT,"Actually, yes. By offering up the blood of the Four
Apostles in the chalice, you can bring someone
back to life.",
32027,SUPPORT,"Saint Seiros performed the ritual 995 years ago,
but not enough blood was given up.",
32027,SUPPORT,"So the ritual was a bust. No clue what happened
after that.",
32027,SUPPORT,"That's what Aelfric concluded after scouring the
records, anyway.",
32027,SUPPORT,"And now, through extreme persistence, he's found
and gathered the four of us, with our Crests.",
32027,SUPPORT,"He placed us under his direct supervision within the
Ashen Wolf House, and he did all of it to ensure a
successful ritual—the Rite of Rising.",
32027,SUPPORT,"You mean to say that he intends to drain our blood?
To kill us?!",
32027,SUPPORT,"Such an act would be unforgivable! An atrocity!
I cannot die in this wretched hovel!",
32027,SUPPORT,"Yeah, that sounds painful...and permanent. Count
me out.",
32027,SUPPORT,"Hang on—the number four includes you too, right?
So you're gonna die too?",
32027,SUPPORT,Yep. That's the idea.,
32027,SUPPORT,"And here I thought we were close, but all this time
you've been skulking around, deceiving us. It hurts,
Boss. Hurts bad.",
32027,SUPPORT,"You wanna die, that it? Fine. I'll kill you myself.
Just stop that crafty nonsense of yours and face me,
fist to fist.",
32027,SUPPORT,Shut it. I've lived through hell and worse.,
32027,SUPPORT,"After clawing my way here, you really think I want
to die?",
32027,SUPPORT,"Then why throw your life away for the likes
of Aelfric?",
32027,SUPPORT,"Some things are more important than my own life.
Some things are worth protecting.",
32027,SUPPORT,You're not making any damned sense!,
32027,SUPPORT,"It would seem that you want to be punished
severely, Yuri.",
32027,SUPPORT,"That some sort of threat? There's not much you can
do to me that hasn't already been done.",
32027,SUPPORT,"True. You took wing from the mud into which you
were born and rose to such great heights.",
32027,SUPPORT,To break your spirit would take far too much effort.,
32027,SUPPORT,"Though, if I must, I will kill your mother in addition
to your dear people.",
32027,SUPPORT,"Oh... So that's it. You were trying to protect
your mom.",
32027,SUPPORT,"Precisely what is it you are hoping to accomplish,
Aelfric?",
32027,SUPPORT,"To resurrect someone I lost long ago—no matter
the cost.",
32027,SUPPORT,Surely there are those for whom you'd do similar.,
32027,SUPPORT,"Perhaps... Even so, never would we annihilate those
we care for!",
32027,SUPPORT,"There's nothing I wouldn't do, nobody I wouldn't
trade to see the light in her eyes once more...",
32027,SUPPORT,"Whoa... That lady looks real dead, pal.",
32027,SUPPORT,She is...for now.,
32028,SUPPORT,"You're gonna regret this, Aelfric.",
32028,SUPPORT,"I accepted the regret I might feel from this long ago.
As long as she returns, nothing else matters.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Yuri, if you think you'll be pulling anything funny,
think again.",
32028,SUPPORT,"The Knights of Seiros won't save you. No doubt
they're indisposed right now on some mission or
other.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Well, that's a damn shame.",
32028,SUPPORT,"The whole evil villain look really doesn't suit
someone as ""pious"" as you, Aelfric. Heh heh...",
32028,SUPPORT,"Yuri-bird, I could—",
32028,SUPPORT,Not yet.,
32028,SUPPORT,It is time. Take them.,
32028,SUPPORT,"Your blood will pour forth, filling the chalice.",
32028,SUPPORT,You really are a fool...,
32028,SUPPORT,"You were diligent, Yuri. You kept me abreast of all
the Ashen Wolves' movements.",
32028,SUPPORT,"As recompense for being such a good student of my
flock, I will gladly hear any final words from you.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Heh, that's fresh. If you knew me at all, you’d know
these won’t be my final words.",
32028,SUPPORT,I'm simply biding my time.,
32028,SUPPORT,For what...,
32028,SUPPORT,"For the goddess's descent. Can you hear it?
She's coming.",
32028,SUPPORT,Bells? This late at night?,
32028,SUPPORT,"Yeah, you hear that, Aelfric? That's the sound of
your demise. The knights are releasing my people
as we speak.",
32028,SUPPORT,The ones you locked up and hid away.,
32028,SUPPORT,"How did you know about that— Wait, the Knights
of Seiros?!",
32028,SUPPORT,"Heh heh... Like I said, the evil villain look really
doesn't suit you.",
32028,SUPPORT,"I know it was you who sent me on that mission that
ultimately led to me landing in Abyss.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Overall, your execution was lacking. Lady Rhea has
been on to you as well.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Oh, and just so you know, I've been working for
her since before I ever began working for you.",
32028,SUPPORT,"She had me keeping an eye on you. Told me to
inform her if you seemed to be planning anything.",
32028,SUPPORT,You!,
32028,SUPPORT,"But you took those I care most about hostage, which
limited my options.",
32028,SUPPORT,"You chained up the Wolves and kept a tight grip on
my rogues in Abyss to ensure I wouldn't betray you.",
32028,SUPPORT,"I struggled with whether or not to tell her
everything. After all, my allies' lives were on
the line.",
32028,SUPPORT,"I deliberated on what to do next, knowing I'd have to
rely on my own cunning to see this through.",
32028,SUPPORT,"I waited for the chance I could rescue my mother
and allies. All while paying lip service to you.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Until today. The day you pulled all your forces in so
you could attempt this ritual.",
32028,SUPPORT,"You're no villain, with that sticky conscience you call
a heart tripping you up. Not like me.",
32028,SUPPORT,...,
32028,SUPPORT,I see. You were one step ahead of me all this time.,
32028,SUPPORT,"It matters not. The ritual has begun. There's no
stopping it now.",
32028,SUPPORT,You will all die. Just a bit longer.,
32028,SUPPORT,Don't think for a moment—,
32028,SUPPORT,"That you're getting off easy, pal!",
32028,SUPPORT,"Seriously, Boss. Did you have to tie us up so tightly?",
32028,SUPPORT,"Heh heh... Sorry, Balthus. I figured those little tears
would be enough for you to break through the rope.",
32028,SUPPORT,"I may be the Unbeatable King of Grappling, but I'm
also bleeding profusely...",
32028,SUPPORT,"You didn't wonder why it was taking me so long?
Think next time, yeah?",
32028,SUPPORT,"I haven't the slightest what you two are jabbering on
about, but please untie our ropes as well!",
32028,SUPPORT,"You're talking. Do it yourself. I dispelled the silence
from you ages ago, or hadn't you noticed?",
32028,SUPPORT,Oh! I see!,
32028,SUPPORT,"It's great that we're not tied up anymore and all that,
but we're still being actively drained...",
32028,SUPPORT,"I've invested everything to ensure my success today.
My private funds, a veritable army...",
32028,SUPPORT,"Surround them! Don't let them escape! The ritual
will not be stopped.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Ugh! Why won't it cease? We are freed, and yet our
blood still drains from us?",
32028,SUPPORT,"Hmmm. Well, this wasn't part of the plan. Haha!",
32028,SUPPORT,"This is no laughing matter! Our very lives are
ebbing away!",
32028,SUPPORT,"Stop panicking, Constance. You know I'm
never unprepared.",
32028,SUPPORT,"Hey, you've always got a trick up your sleeve, don't
ya? I can hear your secret plan running our way.",
32029,SUPPORT,Professor. You would raise your sword against me?,
32029,SUPPORT,"Your mother lies here, waiting for us. Waiting for
you! Don't you want her back?",
32029,SUPPORT,"Teach, is that true, or is he just trying to freak us
out? If so...it's kind of working.",
32029,SUPPORT,My mother died giving birth to me...,
32029,SUPPORT,I don't have a mother.,
32029,SUPPORT,You have no proof that's her.,
32029,SUPPORT,"There is no room for doubt. I know her appearance
better than anyone. This...is her.",
32029,SUPPORT,"An upstanding nun who married Jeralt, she died 21
long years ago...",
32029,SUPPORT,"You cannot expect us to believe that someone
who died two decades ago is still in such
pristine condition...",
32029,SUPPORT,"Incredible, isn't it? It's as though she remains
untouched, even after all these years...",
32029,SUPPORT,"Perhaps her body differs from others. Beautiful,
ageless—perfectly preserved by some secret only
she knows.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Whatever the case may be, it is strange, is it not?",
32029,SUPPORT,"It's been 10 long years since I found her. I came
across her body, frozen in time, deep underground.",
32029,SUPPORT,"I have worked tirelessly to solve the riddle of her
death and bring her back to life.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Halt, Aelfric.",
32029,SUPPORT,Rhea!,
32029,SUPPORT,"You are the cause of this! It was you who killed her!
When she gave birth to a child who made no sound.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Tell me what you've done to her! Why does her
body remain while her spirit does not?!",
32029,SUPPORT,"I owe you no words on the matter. But I will tell
you this...",
32029,SUPPORT,"She made the choice to die, that her offspring
might live.",
32029,SUPPORT,I respected her will. Nothing more.,
32029,SUPPORT,"Aelfric. Just as I viewed her, so do I view you.",
32029,SUPPORT,"You are as my own child. Please, cease this futility.",
32029,SUPPORT,Oho!,
32029,SUPPORT,"You expect that I should believe you without
question?!",
32029,SUPPORT,"You see her lying here before you, and yet you ""owe
no words.""",
32029,SUPPORT,"Rhea, I am finished with you. The only thing that
remains to be done is to complete the ritual.",
32029,SUPPORT,Hurry! He cannot have gone far.,
32029,SUPPORT,Let's end this.,
32029,SUPPORT,"Yes, we must stop him at once. Let's figure out
where he disappeared to.",
32029,SUPPORT,"What about you four? You don't look like you're up
for much of anything right now.",
32029,SUPPORT,"It'll take a lot more than that to stop me. If anything,
I feel speedier with less blood weighing me down.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Probably for the best that he drained us, otherwise
our blood would be boiling.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Ugh, speak for yourselves. I feel atrocious.",
32029,SUPPORT,"We must end this, and swiftly.",
32029,SUPPORT,Count me in.,
32029,SUPPORT,"Then we're all on the same page. But first things
first... Let me see that pretty face of yours, Boss.",
32029,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32029,SUPPORT,Agh!,
32029,SUPPORT,Why the hell didn't you tell us?,
32029,SUPPORT,"I'm sorry I had to use you all. But there wasn't much
choice—someone would've died for sure otherwise.",
32029,SUPPORT,"It could've been any of you. It could've been one of
my rogues, someone from Abyss... Who knows.",
32029,SUPPORT,"You imply that you didn't trust us enough! I am
incensed by you, Yuri.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Use me or don't, but it would've been nice if you'd
asked us first.",
32029,SUPPORT,"Look, I get it. Your people were being held hostage.
You were between a rock and a hard place.",
32029,SUPPORT,But I thought we were pals. Buddies till the end.,
32029,SUPPORT,I...,
32029,SUPPORT,"I need you...all of you. I've been a fool. Thank you
for always being here for me. Even now.",
32029,SUPPORT,"All right, I think this fool gets the picture. Time to
find that other fool and take him down!",
32029,SUPPORT,"You'll help with that, yeah?",
32029,SUPPORT,Obviously.,
32029,SUPPORT,"Haha! I love the lip on this one. Let's do this, 
Wolves.",
32030,SUPPORT,"To me, growing up in the shelter of the monastery,
she was my world...",
32030,SUPPORT,"All of the memories I hold of her—learning, growing,
walking hand in hand—she left me in awe.",
32030,SUPPORT,"If that's what makes her happy, then I will watch her
walk away with warmth in my heart.",
32030,SUPPORT,If that is truly what will make her happy...,
32030,SUPPORT,"Surely he will make her smile. That's all I wanted
for her.",
32030,SUPPORT,"To Sitri, confined within the monastery walls, he was
her world.",
32030,SUPPORT,"I saw the way her eyes glimmered when they spoke.
And her otherworldly smile when they became
engaged.",
32030,SUPPORT,"The look on her face when she told me how happy
she was to bear his child...",
32030,SUPPORT,"It was enough for me to see her happiness—to
witness it from a distance.",
32030,SUPPORT,"She breathed her last, 21 long years ago. I have
never forgotten.",
32030,SUPPORT,"She died before she could see the face of the child
whom she had so lovingly nurtured...",
32030,SUPPORT,"The funeral was a solemn affair. We gathered in the
graveyard, said our farewells, and watched as her
casket was lowered into the soil.",
32030,SUPPORT,That was the end of her story.,
32030,SUPPORT,"Or so I thought. Until 10 years ago, when I found
her—her remains, hidden deep within Abyss.
She looked as beautiful as ever.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Aelfric, cease this at once.",
32031,SUPPORT,"It is too late. The chalice is filled to its brim with
the blood of the four.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Should their blood prove insufficient, I will spill
even my own blood to finish this.",
32031,SUPPORT,"The chalice cannot return her soul, Aelfric.",
32031,SUPPORT,It is incapable even of returning the body to life.,
32031,SUPPORT,"Please, you must stop.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Be not afraid. Today, your mother returns to us.",
32031,SUPPORT,The time has come.,
32031,SUPPORT,Perhaps I am not an equal man to him...,
32031,SUPPORT,"But I am here by your side, Sitri.",
32031,SUPPORT,Sitri... Si...tri...,
32031,SUPPORT,The chalice... It absorbed both of them!,
32031,SUPPORT,That aberration... What is it? An...umbral beast?,
32031,SUPPORT,Sitriii!,
32031,SUPPORT,"So I see... It is just as the last time the ritual
was performed.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Is this really happening? Aelfric turned into...
that thing?!",
32031,SUPPORT,Ugh. It does seem like some kind of sick joke.,
32031,SUPPORT,"So this is the Rite of Rising? Quite the dangerous
ritual, if you ask me...",
32031,SUPPORT,Lady Rhea! Monsters have appeared at the cathedral!,
32031,SUPPORT,Could it be? Perhaps his roar drew them there...,
32031,SUPPORT,Everyone who is capable must fight this beast—now.,
32031,SUPPORT,Archbishop Rhea.,
32031,SUPPORT,"Things ended up this way because of me. Please
allow me to make up for it.",
32031,SUPPORT,Yuri...,
32031,SUPPORT,"It'll give me a chance to hold up my end of the deal.
Let me fight for the church.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! So very like you to steal the glory in the
heat of the moment.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Aelfric used us—he lied to us—and attempted to
slay us.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Despite that, he provided shelter when I had none.",
32031,SUPPORT,"We must end things swiftly, for his sake.",
32031,SUPPORT,"He's never going to be normal again, is he?",
32031,SUPPORT,"For all those years, he tried to make this happen—
bring her back—only to lose himself. That's pretty
awful.",
32031,SUPPORT,He made his choice. All we can do is accept it.,
32031,SUPPORT,"Let's do all of us a favor and take him out real
quick-like, yeah?",
32031,SUPPORT,"We'll help too. Together we stand, together we fall.",
32031,SUPPORT,"Yes, you can rely on us until the very end.",
32031,SUPPORT,Time to lower the curtain on this unfortunate tale.,
32031,SUPPORT,Let's do this.,
32031,SUPPORT,"Please, act swiftly but with great care.",
32031,SUPPORT,"By my order, stop the umbral beast—stop Aelfric!",
32032,SUPPORT,It is finished.,
32032,SUPPORT,"Well done, everyone. Because of you, her restless
soul has finally found peace.",
32032,SUPPORT,Professor... I imagine you have much on your mind.,
32032,SUPPORT,My mother...,
32032,SUPPORT,"I was there the day she brought you forth into
this world.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Sitri had always been frail. Giving birth proved to be
too much for her in the end...",
32032,SUPPORT,"On that fated day, it looked as though neither of you
would survive.",
32032,SUPPORT,"In those final moments, she spoke, saying,
""My heart... Give it to my child.""",
32032,SUPPORT,"From the beginning, my heart wouldn't beat?",
32032,SUPPORT,My mother's heart gave me life?,
32032,SUPPORT,"That is correct. The heart that lies within your chest
is none other than hers.",
32032,SUPPORT,It was the only way that you could be saved.,
32032,SUPPORT,"But Sitri loved others, much as a human might—and
I loved her in return.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Sitri loved others, much as a human might—and I
loved her in return.",
32032,SUPPORT,But why wasn't she buried?,
32032,SUPPORT,"Sitri looked upon me as though I was her mother,
and I wished for her to have a bright future...",
32032,SUPPORT,"I would not have her buried in the cold, dark soil.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Prior to her funeral, I arranged for a fake burial.
Afterward, I brought her body to Abyss, where I
would sometimes visit her.",
32032,SUPPORT,"I never thought that anyone—especially Aelfric—
would find her. I did not expect for such a tragedy
to ensue...",
32032,SUPPORT,"Boss, there's something you gotta tell me.",
32032,SUPPORT,Was Aelfric really just using us all that time?,
32032,SUPPORT,"How should I know? I mean, he always acted that
way around me—like we were a means to an end.",
32032,SUPPORT,"But the church records indicate he founded the
Ashen Wolf House 15 years ago.",
32032,SUPPORT,"He mentioned he found Sitri 10 years ago, so it
seems he really did mean well, at first...",
32032,SUPPORT,"What's done is done. He's gone, and we're here.
That's what matters now.",
32032,SUPPORT,"You're always so quick to adapt to change, Hapi.
I should follow your example.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Heh, yeah, you always get to the heart of things
quickly. Right, then. I've got a lot to take care
of now.",
32032,SUPPORT,"I need to fill the church in on all the details about
how things actually played out.",
32032,SUPPORT,"And with my people freed from the monastery
prison, they'll need to be accounted for.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Good luck with that whole mess. I'll be rooting for
you from afar.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Surely you'll let us know if there is any way at all we
can help. We'd be just thrilled.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Hell, if you want, your people can be my people.
I could use some good mercenaries to watch my
back.",
32032,SUPPORT,Enough already. I get it.,
32032,SUPPORT,It's no less than you deserve.,
32032,SUPPORT,"What you have sown, now you shall reap!",
32032,SUPPORT,"You made your bed, now shut up about it, pal.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Heh... Anyway, what do you figure will happen to
Abyss? The church will want to step in, no doubt.",
32032,SUPPORT,"You got me. After everything that's happened, things
can't stay the same.",
32032,SUPPORT,"The church will probably assign an official to oversee
things. Hopefully whoever they choose knows how
to get along with Abyssians well.",
32032,SUPPORT,"Let's worry about all that some other time, yeah?
I could really use a tall drink and a long sleep.",
32032,SUPPORT,"I'm with you. I hurt in places I didn't even know
could hurt.",
32032,SUPPORT,"It has been a terribly long night, indeed. One I won't
ever forget.",
32032,SUPPORT,"A terribly long night, but a beautiful morning, haha.",
32033,SUPPORT,You mean to say that you are disbanding us?,
32033,SUPPORT,"Yes. After speaking with the cardinals, my decision
is final.",
32033,SUPPORT,"The Ashen Wolf House was originally established for
youths who were in need of the church's protection.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Somewhere along the way, that intent was corrupted,
and it ultimately became a cage for you.",
32033,SUPPORT,"The Ashen Wolves are officially disbanded. You can
consider this a graduation, of sorts.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You can doll this up by calling it graduating, but
you're the one who sent me to Abyss to begin with.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Now you waltz in here and tell us to just go live our
lives, as if none of this ever happened?",
32033,SUPPORT,"You may continue living in Abyss, of course.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Abyss will always be a refuge for those who need
it most.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Your chains have been unbound. You are free to live
as you wish now.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You ask me, this feels like good timing. This sounds
pretty all right, Rhea.",
32033,SUPPORT,"After all I have been through, I must say I feel
immense gratitude at the prospect of living freely.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You're just going to let me go? While I was working
with the church, I still did some unsavory things...",
32033,SUPPORT,"You have already been judged for your
transgressions, Yuri.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You have slain the undeserving. The weight of that is
yours to bear.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You have time to contemplate your actions now.
That is punishment enough.",
32033,SUPPORT,...,
32033,SUPPORT,"What's with the ""woe is me"" act? She's saying you're
a free man!",
32033,SUPPORT,"True enough. It's up to me to determine how I'll live
my life now...how I'll make up for what I've done.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You made up your mind quickly, despite having
ample time to think it through.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! Someone of my many talents must make
decisions in short order—I'm in high demand,
after all.",
32033,SUPPORT,"The Fhirdiad Royal School of Sorcery demands my
presence posthaste. How could I deny them?",
32033,SUPPORT,"Soon, the name Nuvelle shall be renowned all
throughout the Imperial capital—prepare yourselves!",
32033,SUPPORT,"Didn't you already attend that school? Leaving and
going back seems... Eh, well, good luck with that.",
32033,SUPPORT,Maybe I'll try to see my family again.,
32033,SUPPORT,"It's been forever, but now seems like as good a time
as any to do that.",
32033,SUPPORT,"The whole thing might be a drag, though, so maybe
I'll come straight back to Abyss.",
32033,SUPPORT,"I think I'll... Yeah, yep! I'll find a way to hit it big—
make tons of money!",
32033,SUPPORT,"It's about time the Indebted King of Grappling
finally paid down all those damn debts.",
32033,SUPPORT,"You could always ask my brother to help you out.
Seems like a good way to go, really.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Borrow from Holst? That's a hard no! Wouldn't dare
to trouble my best pal like that.",
32033,SUPPORT,"That's enough about me. What are you going to
do now, Boss?",
32033,SUPPORT,"Eh, who knows. For now I'll take some time to think.",
32033,SUPPORT,"My main concern at this point is taking care of
my people back in my hometown.",
32033,SUPPORT,You mean you'll continue your former line of work?,
32033,SUPPORT,"No need to beat around the bush. And yeah, that's
the plan. It's what I'm best at.",
32033,SUPPORT,"But I can approach things differently now. Change
how I live—find ways to thrive in peace, you know?",
32033,SUPPORT,Makes sense to me. I wish you all the best.,
32033,SUPPORT,"Thanks, friend. Right back at you. We both deserve
to live our lives freely.",
32033,SUPPORT,"I may end up back home after all this, but I worry
about how my rogues here would fare without a boss.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Always worrying about everyone but yourself.
Stop with that already, yeah?",
32033,SUPPORT,"Yeah, you don't need to be concerned.",
32033,SUPPORT,I'll look after Abyss.,
32033,SUPPORT,There you go being cute again.,
32033,SUPPORT,"Though I'm certain if you're around, Abyss and
everyone in it will be just fine.",
32033,SUPPORT,"We'll keep an eye on Abyss, as well. Isn't that right,
you two?",
32033,SUPPORT,"Absolutely. That place is a treasure trove of secrets.
Just try to keep me away.",
32033,SUPPORT,"I trust your motives are not all so selfish, Claude.
And yes, we promise to protect Abyss in
your absence.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Boss! Boss! You can't just leave us high and dry like
this? Where will we go? What will we do?",
32033,SUPPORT,I should've known...,
32033,SUPPORT,"Humans are adaptable creatures. You'll sort it out
just fine.",
32033,SUPPORT,"Heh, relax, will ya? We all know Yuri's not the type
to abandon his pals.",
32033,SUPPORT,"He's a guy who always turns up when he's needed.
Hell, we should all be taking notes from him.",
32033,SUPPORT,"The world's a dreary place. We could all use a little
help now and again.",
32033,SUPPORT,"As long as we're all here for each other as true
friends, we can live our lives to the fullest.",
32033,SUPPORT,Friends...,
32033,SUPPORT,"You heard me. You're all my friends... You matter.
You always will.",
32033,SUPPORT,That seems like a good note to end on.,
32033,SUPPORT,"Sure does. Catch ya later, pals. I mean...friends.",
32033,SUPPORT,"With that, I bid you farewell! Hehe!",
32033,SUPPORT,"And so it is. Until next time, friend.",
32056,SUPPORT,"What to do? What to do... Not really sure I should
be trusting him...",
32056,SUPPORT,But if I can make a decent profit...,
32056,SUPPORT,What about profits?,
32056,SUPPORT,Let me help.,
32056,SUPPORT,"Hi, Professor! Overheard me mumbling about
profits? See, I got a lead on a pretty big job, but
I've got some concerns.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Professor! You need some money? Of course you do!
I've got the perfect job for you.",
32056,SUPPORT,Although it's not without its issues.,
32056,SUPPORT,A job?,
32056,SUPPORT,"Yup. Apparently, there's some priceless treasure
that's been unearthed. If you can believe it,
it predates the Adrestian Empire!",
32056,SUPPORT,"I've been asked to secure troops for the job, but I've
got to cover the cost for them.",
32056,SUPPORT,"The upside is, whatever we find, we get halfsies on!
But there's a downside too.",
32056,SUPPORT,The potential to find...nothing?,
32056,SUPPORT,"Bingo. If we find nothing, I'll be eating those
up-front costs. But just imagine the gold if we do
find something. It's a risk I'm willing to take.",
32056,SUPPORT,"This job is coming from a merchant named Pallardó.
Ever heard of him?",
32056,SUPPORT,"He frequents the monastery, so he must be somewhat
trustworthy... Right?",
32056,SUPPORT,You know what? Yeah. I'm gonna do it! You in?,
32056,SUPPORT,I've got a bad feeling about this.,
32056,SUPPORT,I'll have to decline.,
32056,SUPPORT,I accept your challenge.,
32056,SUPPORT,"What do you mean? Money will be raining down
from the heavens! Isn't that enticing enough?
I need you!",
32056,SUPPORT,"Whoa, hold your horses there—lemme get through
my pitch! I really need your help with excavation.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Jeez, it's not a challenge. I just need your help
with excavation.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Your job's gonna be to find someone who can
help out, and then I'll need you on board at the
excavation site.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Naturally, the more treasure we dig up, the more
money you get. Sound good?",
32056,SUPPORT,I'll find the treasure. (Begin Paralogue battle),
32056,SUPPORT,I'm busy right now. (Return to previous screen),
32056,SUPPORT,"Your services are appreciated, as always!
Let's head out!",
32056,SUPPORT,"I can hang around for a bit. Let me know if you
change your mind, OK?",
32056,SUPPORT,"Haha, come on! We'll be rolling in gold!",
32056,SUPPORT,Wait.,
32056,SUPPORT,Uh... You? Starting a conversation? I'm confused.,
32056,SUPPORT,I'll go.,
32056,SUPPORT,It's not a battle.,
32056,SUPPORT,Are you into treasure hunting?,
32056,SUPPORT,"I smell blood... Anna, I sense a death about you.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Not particularly. But I smell blood... Anna, I sense
death about you.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's with the gloomy death
talk? You're scaring me!",
32056,SUPPORT,"I... Uh. Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt for you to
join in, then. Shall we?",
32056,SUPPORT,"We really hit the jackpot! Just look at all those
shinies! Ah yes, we'll be filthy rich.",
32056,SUPPORT,"As you say, Miss Anna. Thanks to you, we've
achieved our goals.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Uh, hey, Pallardó? What's with the cavalry?",
32056,SUPPORT,"Ah, they're here to transport the treasures. It's quite
a load, after all.",
32056,SUPPORT,"You trying to pull something? We agreed on a
fifty-fifty split!",
32056,SUPPORT,"Yes, you have it right. Stop fretting about it.",
32056,SUPPORT,"You'll be receiving your cut just as soon as
I determine the exact value.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Nuh-uh. No way, no how. I can't agree to that. As a
merchant yourself, you know I can't.",
32056,SUPPORT,"No way am I watching my share of the treasure
gallop off into the sunset.",
32056,SUPPORT,"We're splitting this up right here and now. I'm not
agreeing to it any other way.",
32056,SUPPORT,"Whether or not you agree, I'll be on my way now.
Come on then, men! Let's go.",
32056,SUPPORT,Wait! Come back here!,
32056,SUPPORT,"And now it's a hunt rather than a battle.
How very boring.",
32056,SUPPORT,Let's go. (Begin Paralogue battle),
32056,SUPPORT,Hold on. (Return to previous screen),
32057,SUPPORT,That was time spent in vain.,
32057,SUPPORT,"No, it wasn't! Thank you, everyone, for all the help.",
32057,SUPPORT,I didn't expect it'd come to this...,
32057,SUPPORT,"That makes two of us. But either way, I'm still
grateful for your aid.",
32057,SUPPORT,"And just look at how much we got back. It should
cover all our costs and then some!",
32057,SUPPORT,You'll be rewarded handsomely!,
32057,SUPPORT,"I wish we'd gotten more of our money back. But we
did pretty well anyway, and it's all thanks to you!",
32057,SUPPORT,You'll receive a fair reward.,
32057,SUPPORT,"You win some, you lose some...",
32057,SUPPORT,I promise you'll be rewarded.,
32057,SUPPORT,Thank you.,
32057,SUPPORT,Only if you can afford it.,
32057,SUPPORT,"Oh, I can afford it. Don't you worry!",
32057,SUPPORT,"After all, as a top-tier merchant, I always account
for losses.",
32057,SUPPORT,"Though if that guy calls himself a merchant, maybe
I shouldn't call myself one.",
32057,SUPPORT,"We'd better submit a proper report and get some
people to teach him a real lesson.",
32057,SUPPORT,"We'd better let Hubert know all about this so he can
give him what for.",
32057,SUPPORT,There's no need. I'll take care of him.,
32057,SUPPORT,"Jeritza, wait! And...he's off. Welp.",
32057,SUPPORT,"I almost feel bad for Pallardó. No, wait—he tried to
rip me off! I don't feel bad at all!",
32058,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. Any idea where Hapi is?",
32058,SUPPORT,No clue.,
32058,SUPPORT,I haven't seen her.,
32058,SUPPORT,Right. This is bad. Real bad.,
32058,SUPPORT,Huh. This is bad. Real bad.,
32058,SUPPORT,What's bad?,
32058,SUPPORT,"It's nothing. Well... OK, fine. If you insist, I'll tell
you what's happened.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Thing is...a box was delivered yesterday. Filled with
feathers. Pricey ones. For bedding.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Hapi loves a good nap, so she climbed on in.
Now she and the box are nowhere to be found.",
32058,SUPPORT,"I checked with my merchant contacts. Turns out it
was taken to Enbarr to be sold...on the black market.",
32058,SUPPORT,"You catch what I'm throwing, yeah? Hapi was fast
asleep in the thing when it was stolen...",
32058,SUPPORT,That can't be true.,
32058,SUPPORT,That sounds completely believable.,
32058,SUPPORT,"Oh, but it can. That's Hapi for you.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Thanks. I mean, yeah. That's Hapi for you.",
32058,SUPPORT,"She runs like clockwork, that one. Goes to bed at
sunset and won't wake up until sunrise.",
32058,SUPPORT,"If we don't go and find her, something terrible
could happen.",
32058,SUPPORT,"One sigh and a demonic beast could come barreling
through town...",
32058,SUPPORT,"If that were true, that would be bad.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Right! Way I see it, I have no choice but to rush off
and rescue her. You in?",
32058,SUPPORT,I'm in. (Begin Paralogue battle),
32058,SUPPORT,I'm out. (Return to previous screen),
32058,SUPPORT,"Heh, knew I could count on you! Let's get to it.",
32058,SUPPORT,"You're really going to abandon her? Didn't think you
had it in ya. If you change your mind, just holler.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Finally, we're here.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Now where's Hapi? We've gotta find her before that
box is sold...",
32058,SUPPORT,"Let's split up and search the town. We'll cover more
ground that way.",
32058,SUPPORT,Still no sign of her...,
32058,SUPPORT,I know. Where in the hell could she—Gah!,
32058,SUPPORT,"I can't believe you, B! Well, I can, but that doesn't
make me any less angry.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Whoa, easy there! I have a good reason. Trust me.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Don't even try to weasel your way out of this.
Ooh, you're the worst!",
32058,SUPPORT,What's going on?,
32058,SUPPORT,I'm glad we found you.,
32058,SUPPORT,He's the actual worst.,
32058,SUPPORT,"Don't ask me. I was just relaxing in Abyss, and when
I came to the surface, everyone was gone.",
32058,SUPPORT,"When I heard he was dragging you here I nearly
threw a fit!",
32058,SUPPORT,"You didn't need to find me. I was relaxing in Abyss.
He made up that story as an excuse to drag you here.",
32058,SUPPORT,"You don't even know what I did yet. Not that you're
wrong, but still.",
32058,SUPPORT,"Look, I may be a scoundrel, but I stand by what
I did. Let me explain.",
32058,SUPPORT,"I got a tip-off that an item was being sold on the
black market today. Not just any item. My mom's—",
32058,SUPPORT,"There you are! How dare you interfere with
our business!",
32058,SUPPORT,"You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into.
You're finished!",
32058,SUPPORT,"We'll continue story time later. First, I'll need your
help clearing out these thugs.",
32058,SUPPORT,Let's go. (Begin Paralogue battle),
32058,SUPPORT,Hold on. (Return to previous screen),
32059,SUPPORT,So what's the story with this Hero's Relic?,
32059,SUPPORT,"It's not exactly a real Relic, per se.",
32059,SUPPORT,It's not?,
32059,SUPPORT,Nope. It's a replica. Crafted after the War of Heroes.,
32059,SUPPORT,"It's a secret family heirloom of sorts from my
mom's village.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Somehow, word of it got out recently. As happens
with valuable things, it was stolen soon after.",
32059,SUPPORT,"So when you heard it might be on the black market,
you tricked others into helping you steal it by telling
them I'd been kidnapped.",
32059,SUPPORT,"You're still mad, yeah? Look, I'm sorry. OK? There.
You can go ahead and cheer up now.",
32059,SUPPORT,"I only did it because if they turned into monsters,
there was a chance I couldn't take 'em on my own.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Couldn't risk telling you the truth. If the church had
caught wind, they'd have taken it for themselves.",
32059,SUPPORT,"How uncharacteristically wise of you, B. So that's
why you felt a need for this bizarre scheme.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Oh, and, Professor. Guess I owe you an apology too.
Sorry. Shouldn't have done you like that.",
32059,SUPPORT,You're forgiven.,
32059,SUPPORT,I'm still mad.,
32059,SUPPORT,"I guess if Chatterbox can forgive you, I can too.
You were doing it for your family, after all.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Maybe we should cut him some slack, Chatterbox.
He was doing it for his family. That's kinda sweet.",
32059,SUPPORT,"What was up with that noble guy, though? He didn't
seem interested in hearing what we had to say.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Yeah, good point. I wonder why he wanted this
thing to begin with.",
32059,SUPPORT,"It seems Baron Ochs has passed away. That's who
you're referring to, I presume?",
32059,SUPPORT,Eddy. Do you know why he was after this thing?,
32059,SUPPORT,"I can't say for certain, but it's possible he wanted that
item for his daughter.",
32059,SUPPORT,"I don't know for certain, but it's likely he wanted
that item for his daughter.",
32059,SUPPORT,"The man in question is Baron Ochs. He is a minor
noble from the west of the Empire.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Based on Imperial reports, his daughter Monica went
missing last year.",
32059,SUPPORT,"His daughter Monica went missing last year. She was
found only recently.",
32059,SUPPORT,"His daughter went missing last year. Unfortunately,
it's unlikely that she's still alive.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Monica, the girl Kronya was impersonating...
She was Baron Ochs's daughter.",
32059,SUPPORT,"What does that have to do with the Relic?
Uh, the non-Relic, I mean.",
32059,SUPPORT,Word has it that Baron Ochs received a proposition.,
32059,SUPPORT,"His daughter's safe return, in exchange for a
Hero's Relic.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Of course. This whole mess happened because
somebody wanted to get their mitts on a Relic.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Could be folks like Kronya and Solon were pulling
the strings themselves.",
32059,SUPPORT,"It's possible. But we weren't able to get anything out
of Baron Ochs.",
32059,SUPPORT,"The head of that house died years ago, and the
whole family has been a mess ever since.",
32059,SUPPORT,"We have no choice but to find another source for
that information.",
32059,SUPPORT,...,
32059,SUPPORT,"Are you sure you want to return this thing to your
village? People might come looking for it.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Good point. I actually got a letter from my mom
on the subject.",
32059,SUPPORT,"She suggested it would be safer in Garreg Mach.
She also said my Crest should allow me to use it...",
32059,SUPPORT,"She's entrusting it to me...which is a bad idea,
so I'm entrusting it to you, Professor.",
32059,SUPPORT,Are you sure?,
32059,SUPPORT,"Positive. You'll know what to do with it. Give it to
me or someone else, whatever you think.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Um, B... That's a priceless artifact.",
32059,SUPPORT,"Sure is. Lose it and you'll owe me, heh!",
32060,SUPPORT,Ahahaha!,
32060,SUPPORT,"What is with you? Finally coming apart at the seams
from all those late nights spent researching, huh?",
32060,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! For once, your sharp tongue misses its mark.",
32060,SUPPORT,"My elation is too powerful for your petty sniping
to have any effect!",
32060,SUPPORT,Why is that?,
32060,SUPPORT,That's a good thing.,
32060,SUPPORT,"Aren't you curious as to the reason? No matter,
I shall tell you anyway.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Not long ago, the church reached out to me.
They bade me travel to House Gerth, escorted
by the knights.",
32060,SUPPORT,"During the Dagda and Brigid war, you see, Houses
Nuvelle and Gerth fought side by side.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Yet we were the ones who suffered wrack and ruin,
while they kept their Foreign Ministry position.",
32060,SUPPORT,"I cannot turn back time to change that, of course.",
32060,SUPPORT,"But I would relish the opportunity to give
Duke Gerth a proper tongue-lashing!",
32060,SUPPORT,"I guess that is one of your pastimes, isn't it? Anyway,
seems the church has business with House Gerth.",
32060,SUPPORT,What of House Gerth?,
32060,SUPPORT,What does the church want with the house?,
32060,SUPPORT,"Gerth is one of the Six Great Noble Houses. They
oversee the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
32060,SUPPORT,"And the ministry is in charge of diplomacy for other
regions and territories.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Of the Six Great Noble Houses, it is the one which
oversees the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
32060,SUPPORT,"The church wishes to obtain a Hero's Relic thought
to reside in House Gerth's collection.",
32060,SUPPORT,"The delicate negotiations of acquiring it fall to me,
due to my connection with the duke.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Ah, a Hero's Relic...",
32060,SUPPORT,"I thought they were all returned to the descendants
of the 10 Elites by the church ages ago.",
32060,SUPPORT,"House Gerth has no ties to the elites, and I don't
think the head even has a Crest.",
32060,SUPPORT,Odd indeed for them to have a Relic.,
32060,SUPPORT,"There is talk that the Relic fell into his hands during
the Dagda and Brigid war.",
32060,SUPPORT,The Church of Seiros was displeased to learn this.,
32060,SUPPORT,"They feel the Relic should belong to them and
have made that plain to House Gerth.",
32060,SUPPORT,Do we know how the duke acquired it?,
32060,SUPPORT,"I believe the Relic was found in a foreign land where
it was mistaken for a marvelous, but benign, treasure.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Then it was probably gifted as recompense to
House Gerth, as part of a reconciliation.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Who can say why it had landed on foreign shores to
begin with, though.",
32060,SUPPORT,You seem rather well-informed on the subject.,
32060,SUPPORT,Yeah...how do you know so much?,
32060,SUPPORT,You're certain of all this?,
32060,SUPPORT,"Eh, I caught wind of some of the story, which piqued
my interest.",
32060,SUPPORT,"I did some digging and drew conclusions, like I tend
to do. So what you've got is what I think—nothing
more.",
32060,SUPPORT,"Anyway. Constance. If you're headed to
House Gerth, so am I.",
32060,SUPPORT,What game are you playing here?,
32060,SUPPORT,"No games—this time. I just want to get a gander at
that shiny Relic they're keeping hidden away.",
32060,SUPPORT,"I haven't the authority to prevent it, but if you must
accompany us, I should like the professor along too.",
32060,SUPPORT,"The more eyes watching this snake, the better.",
32060,SUPPORT,"I think you've confused a snake with a bird. You
coming, friend?",
32060,SUPPORT,I'll join. (Begin Paralogue battle),
32060,SUPPORT,"No, thank you. (Return to previous screen)",
32060,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! I knew you'd see things my way. Allow me
to make a few quick preparations and we can depart.",
32060,SUPPORT,"What a delicious frisson it gives me to imagine the
look upon the duke's face! Ahaha!",
32060,SUPPORT,"I sure hope the church knows what they're doing,
choosing her to negotiate this...",
32060,SUPPORT,"I guess this was all pretty abrupt, wasn't it? Let me
know if you change your mind, yeah?",
32061,SUPPORT,"Thank the goddess you were unharmed, my lord.
And that the Relic is safe and sound.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Yes, thanks to your intervention. Today was a day
to make my blood run cold.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Colder than a Sreng winter, I'd wager. Our foes gave
us a pitched battle...",
32061,SUPPORT,We couldn't save them...,
32061,SUPPORT,That suspicious-looking mage gave us the slip...,
32061,SUPPORT,Yeah... They were nothing more than pawns...,
32061,SUPPORT,"I am sorry to say that the ringleader's escape was
my fault.",
32061,SUPPORT,"It is a miracle that no harm came to your lordship or
the Relic in spite of my clumsy efforts.",
32061,SUPPORT,"You don't sound quite yourself, Constance.
I'd no idea what a toll life has taken on you.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Perhaps it might cheer you to know that I intend to
reward you for all that you've done today.",
32061,SUPPORT,"For more than that, actually. I owe your parents
a great debt for their services.",
32061,SUPPORT,"I dare say that the church intended you to collect
on it when they sent you.",
32061,SUPPORT,"The debt you owed my parents need not extend to
their daughter. No reward shall be necessary.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Our help doesn't come for free. I think the Relic
will do nicely.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Ah... Yes, by all means. Even if you have no use
for it, perhaps you know somebody who does.",
32061,SUPPORT,"These are the Fetters of Dromi. They draw on the
power of the Crest of Aubin.",
32061,SUPPORT,"It's a priceless treasure that ended up in Dagda.
After the truce, they sent it to us in friendship.",
32061,SUPPORT,Why did Dagda have a Hero's Relic?,
32061,SUPPORT,"One story holds that Saint Seiros subjugated the
10 Elites and the clans who followed them.",
32061,SUPPORT,"There may have been a few clan elders who fled
across the sea to escape suppression.",
32061,SUPPORT,Why didn't you respond to the church's demand?,
32061,SUPPORT,What did you intend to do with the Relic?,
32061,SUPPORT,"The Empire's Minister of Foreign Affairs must hold
on to every bit of leverage that he can.",
32061,SUPPORT,"As the Empire's relations with the church have
chilled, it makes for a strong card to play.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Which is why I feel a bit derelict in my duty here.
I've put my feelings ahead of my role.",
32061,SUPPORT,How so?,
32061,SUPPORT,"The Minister of Foreign Affairs appears to be
discarding his hand in order to repay a personal debt.",
32061,SUPPORT,My lord...,
32061,SUPPORT,"Oh, what a relief to be back at the monastery!
I suppose the church will be wanting their Relic.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Yeah, they might, but I've got grander plans for it.",
32061,SUPPORT,What?! Of all the self-centered—,
32061,SUPPORT,"Wait. Do you mean to say that you're compatible?
You bear the Crest of Aubin?",
32061,SUPPORT,"Very good, Constance! Hey, friend, I've got
a request.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Can you talk the church into letting me borrow the
Relic for a bit?",
32061,SUPPORT,"If you believe anyone would lend you a Relic,
your wits are softer than I gave you credit for!",
32061,SUPPORT,"The Crest of Aubin has all but vanished from Fódlan.
Nobody but me carries it now.",
32061,SUPPORT,"I'm the only one in all of Fódlan who can use it.
The church hanging on to it is useless.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Letting me make use of it is simply practical.
Otherwise it'll just be gathering dust in some stinky
old vault.",
32061,SUPPORT,That makes sense. I'll talk to the church for you.,
32061,SUPPORT,"You won't be using it for anything nefarious, right?",
32061,SUPPORT,"Don't you worry your pretty little head. I won't use
it for ill. I'd never be able to make it up to Duke
Gerth, after all.",
32061,SUPPORT,"You can keep an eye on them while they're on loan.
That'll make this whole thing go over easy as pie.",
32061,SUPPORT,"So this was the game you began when you offered
your assistance. Well played.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Thanks! I figure the duke has no use for them,
and neither does the church. But I sure do.",
32061,SUPPORT,"Ultimately, I want to use them to benefit the greater
good. There's certainly no harm in that.",
32077,SUPPORT,...,
32077,SUPPORT,What's the matter? Not hungry?,
32077,SUPPORT,What...is that...,
32077,SUPPORT,"I am partaking in some sweet delights. Is there
a problem?",
32077,SUPPORT,That's unexpected.,
32077,SUPPORT,You...have a sweet tooth?,
32077,SUPPORT,Yes...,
32077,SUPPORT,"I am a person too... What I eat is nobody's business
but my own.",
32077,SUPPORT,"If you need something, spit it out. My ice cream
is melting.",
32077,SUPPORT,I don't need anything.,
32077,SUPPORT,I came to see if you'd join me for training.,
32077,SUPPORT,Then leave.,
32077,SUPPORT,Perhaps after I finish devouring this treat.,
32077,SUPPORT,...,
32077,SUPPORT,Are you really the Death Knight?,
32077,SUPPORT,I am. And I am not.,
32077,SUPPORT,"At the moment, I am Jeritza von Hrym.",
32077,SUPPORT,"The emperor and the army know me only as the
Death Knight...",
32077,SUPPORT,"But he is merely an illusion—a demon who resides in
my heart. He is not me. Not who I am at my core.",
32077,SUPPORT,"He thrives and feasts upon blood, death, suffering...",
32077,SUPPORT,"So while I sit here eating, I prefer to just be
myself. Jeritza.",
32077,SUPPORT,I would like to be who I truly am.,
32077,SUPPORT,...,
32077,SUPPORT,...,
32077,SUPPORT,"I am incapable of enjoying my dessert with you
gawking at me like that.",
32077,SUPPORT,I have no further words for you. Go.,
32077,SUPPORT,(Wow... He likes ice cream...),
32078,SUPPORT,"Lord Jeritza? I believe he used to be a professor at
the Officers Academy.",
32078,SUPPORT,"It was also my understanding that he was personally
recommended by Lord Arundel himself, landing him
a position as a sword instructor.",
32078,SUPPORT,"Whatever the case is, behind that mask of death,
there is an emptiness... A void...",
32078,SUPPORT,"This is probably just a rumor, but I heard he was
found and taken in by Her Majesty herself...",
32078,SUPPORT,"Supposedly he's the heir of the Hrym family, but
I also heard he's only a distant relative who was
adopted. He sure is mysterious...",
32078,SUPPORT,You've been asking around about me.,
32078,SUPPORT,I have.,
32078,SUPPORT,I have not.,
32078,SUPPORT,"It matters not to me, one way or the other. Do you
want to know of my past?",
32078,SUPPORT,I do.,
32078,SUPPORT,I don't.,
32078,SUPPORT,Why?,
32078,SUPPORT,Then why bother asking around?,
32078,SUPPORT,"Friend or foe. That's what you're trying
to determine.",
32078,SUPPORT,"But you won't find answers merely with words.
There is only one path forward. Raise your sword,
if you have the nerve.",
32078,SUPPORT,"Raise it and fight me. If you want to know my heart,
know my sword.",
32078,SUPPORT,I must fight you?,
32078,SUPPORT,I'm not a fan of bloodshed.,
32078,SUPPORT,It's only to spar. Nobody will be slain.,
32078,SUPPORT,"I cannot kill you yet. The Death Knight knows that
very well.",
32078,SUPPORT,"I've been told to refrain from killing you until the
war has ended.",
32078,SUPPORT,By whom?,
32078,SUPPORT,Tell me more.,
32078,SUPPORT,The emperor.,
32078,SUPPORT,"I came to an understanding with the emperor herself
and agreed to do her bidding.",
32078,SUPPORT,"The young emperor discovered me, long ago...
Though, back then, she was still a princess.",
32078,SUPPORT,"Ultimately, it was she who erased my past. She
placed me into a family that was disintegrating,
that I might be their heir.",
32078,SUPPORT,"Your past, you say?",
32078,SUPPORT,So it was Edelgard...,
32078,SUPPORT,"Indeed. My past. My crimes for killing a useless man
and his kin.",
32078,SUPPORT,"To survive, the Death Knight must spill blood. Left
to his own devices, he would kill innocent passersby.",
32078,SUPPORT,"Through the emperor's grace, he was allowed
hunting grounds. That is why, to this day,
I follow her.",
32078,SUPPORT,"I am not yet ready to yield such fertile hunting
grounds. Nor am I ready to truly fight you...",
32078,SUPPORT,"Of course, were I not here to hold him back, he
would cut you down without hesitation.",
32078,SUPPORT,"As for me, I, too... Never mind.",
32078,SUPPORT,"If you've no intention of fighting, then be gone.",
32078,SUPPORT,"Perhaps it is he who is to blame, but I... I feel...oddly
when I look at you...",
32079,SUPPORT,"The way your sword glides through the air...
I am in awe...",
32079,SUPPORT,"You...paired with that sword... It may bring about
my end.",
32079,SUPPORT,I would never kill an ally.,
32079,SUPPORT,Do you want to die?,
32079,SUPPORT,So weak. That weakness will be your end.,
32079,SUPPORT,I...I do not know. Perhaps I do.,
32079,SUPPORT,"Long ago...when the Death Knight saw you in the
Holy Mausoleum, I came to an understanding.",
32079,SUPPORT,"That it is you, and you alone, who are capable of
slaying me. Only you, with your sword, can do it.",
32079,SUPPORT,"Upon reflection, I can see that our encounter was
fated to happen.",
32079,SUPPORT,"Ever since then, I've been thinking...",
32079,SUPPORT,Why was I chosen?,
32079,SUPPORT,That there are others stronger than me?,
32079,SUPPORT,"Why, indeed? Why was the Death Knight fixated
so fervently upon you?",
32079,SUPPORT,Perhaps that is so.,
32079,SUPPORT,"At that moment, he fell under your spell. You who
wields the Sword of the Creator.",
32079,SUPPORT,"And now, as I fight alongside you, I too fall victim to
your spell.",
32079,SUPPORT,That I am unable to fight you is truly regrettable.,
32079,SUPPORT,Should we fight? Here and now?,
32079,SUPPORT,First we must end the war.,
32079,SUPPORT,Now is not the time.,
32079,SUPPORT,"Yes, I suppose that is true. This futile, pointless war.
Let us end it quickly, then.",
32079,SUPPORT,"Uniting Fódlan and overthrowing the church are
mere trivialities to me.",
32079,SUPPORT,"All I truly need is you... You, and nothing else.",
32079,SUPPORT,I... It feels like you like me...,
32079,SUPPORT,That sounds very nice...,
32079,SUPPORT,"Perhaps that is true, viewed in a certain light.",
32079,SUPPORT,"It does. In the meantime, continue to strengthen
your swordplay.",
32079,SUPPORT,"And please don't get yourself killed by some
foolish brigands.",
32079,SUPPORT,"You must live, that we might fight one
another to the death. I must know which
one of us will emerge victorious.",
32079,SUPPORT,"For now, I will have to use my imagination and savor
the potential outcomes of that future.",
32079,SUPPORT,"I can see it now. You, swiftly dodging my blade, and
then at last, your sword piercing my flesh.",
32079,SUPPORT,"I stumble to the ground, gasping for air, breathing
my last. Or perhaps... Perhaps my blade will pierce
you first.",
32079,SUPPORT,Do you...really want to keep going with this?,
32079,SUPPORT,"No. That is enough. I must refrain from such
fantasies—they make my urge to slay you all
the stronger.",
32079,SUPPORT,"It is enough to stand by your side while I await
that day of true pleasure.",
32079,SUPPORT,I am counting on you.,
32079,SUPPORT,I look forward to fighting you.,
32079,SUPPORT,Indeed.,
32079,SUPPORT,"You and I are fated to be intertwined. I will follow
you to the very gates of hell.",
32080,SUPPORT,Huh! Hyah!,
32080,SUPPORT,Hya!,
32080,SUPPORT,"Utterly boring. These kills are worth less than
nothing to me.",
32080,SUPPORT,Are you done? Let's move on already.,
32080,SUPPORT,"The war has ended, and yet this incessant swatting at
flies never ceases.",
32080,SUPPORT,"I have yet to claim my moment to kill you,
it would seem.",
32080,SUPPORT,We will settle this.,
32080,SUPPORT,You won't be killing me.,
32080,SUPPORT,"Yes, we will. It is all that I live for now.",
32080,SUPPORT,"Ah, or will I? The clash of spirits fighting for
their lives—battle is the one thing that puts blood
in my veins.",
32080,SUPPORT,"Funny, is it not? That we should fight toward the
same end, only to vanquish one another in time.",
32080,SUPPORT,It's rare to see you smile.,
32080,SUPPORT,You find it funny?,
32080,SUPPORT,"I do not quite know how to articulate these
curious feelings...",
32080,SUPPORT,"I think it could be described as...contentment?
Perhaps it stems from discovering such a creature
as you...",
32080,SUPPORT,"Perhaps funny was a poor word choice. Happy.
Content. Yes, those are better words.",
32080,SUPPORT,"All this time, I had determined it was the Death
Knight who was drawn to you...",
32080,SUPPORT,"Yet, fighting alongside you, I have come to
realize that you are the only being who truly
means anything to me.",
32080,SUPPORT,"Once we exterminate the rats lurking below ground,
and all of this madness is settled...",
32080,SUPPORT,"Once that finally happens, all of this will long
be forgotten. And we shall indulge in the finer
things. Together.",
32080,SUPPORT,I look forward to it.,
32080,SUPPORT,"Until that day comes, you must survive.",
32080,SUPPORT,Indeed.,
32080,SUPPORT,"I abandoned all that I am. My true name, whatever
remnants were left of my past...",
32080,SUPPORT,"But now, with the chance to fight you... It is my only
reason for existing.",
32080,SUPPORT,"I finally understand. It is you alone who can slay the
demon that lives inside of me... The Death Knight...",
32080,SUPPORT,"This strange feeling rising up within me... Is this
what is called...love?",
32080,SUPPORT,It may be.,
32080,SUPPORT,I feel the same way.,
32080,SUPPORT,That...pleases me.,
32080,SUPPORT,"Let us away, then. Beyond these shadows that we
have dwelt in for so long.",
32080,SUPPORT,"To the very depths of hell, I will tumble down
with you.",
32081,SUPPORT,...,
32081,SUPPORT,"Where are you headed, this late at night?",
32081,SUPPORT,"Ah, it's you.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Where I'm going is hardly your business. Do me a
favor and mind your own, won't you?",
32081,SUPPORT,You got it.,
32081,SUPPORT,You really shouldn't be out so late.,
32081,SUPPORT,"I somehow doubt your sincerity. My intuition says
you'll keep nosing into what I'm doing.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Heh heh. Ever the professor, aren't you?",
32081,SUPPORT,So what's your deal? Worried about my well-being?,
32081,SUPPORT,Not so much.,
32081,SUPPORT,Just a bit.,
32081,SUPPORT,"Knowing where I come from, it makes sense you
wouldn't be.",
32081,SUPPORT,"A leisurely stroll about town in the middle of the
night is obviously nothing new for me.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Ha, that's adorable. I get the sense you're not so hot
at assessing people.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Just giving you a hard time. Either way, it doesn't
matter much to me.",
32081,SUPPORT,"There's no slowing me down tonight. I've got
important things to attend to right now.",
32081,SUPPORT,Like what?,
32081,SUPPORT,"There you go with that nose of yours. It still isn't
your business, but it looks like you won't let me
leave until I tell you.",
32081,SUPPORT,"You get your way—this time. There's a dispute. Or
maybe treachery is the more fitting word. Regardless,
a purge is required.",
32081,SUPPORT,What sort of treachery?,
32081,SUPPORT,What do you mean by...purge?,
32081,SUPPORT,"I see I've gotta spell it all out for you. One of my
goons double-crossed the gang.",
32081,SUPPORT,"He absconded with his boss's small fortune—my
small fortune—and buddied up with another gang.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Members of the gang are recognizable by their
scorpion tattoos. Suffice it to say they're not a
group you want to tangle with.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Despite that, I'm not about to just roll over and play
dead on this.",
32081,SUPPORT,"So I figured I'd pay them a little visit—have a spot
of tea with their boss. Makes sense, you know?",
32081,SUPPORT,"I don't know... No, it's dangerous.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Yeah, makes sense.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Like I'm not aware? Wow, friend, you clearly
underestimate me.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Heh, as a former mercenary, I knew you'd get it. You
know how things are done in our world.",
32081,SUPPORT,"I play my cards wisely. I wouldn't play if there wasn't
any hope of winning.",
32081,SUPPORT,I'd like to help you.,
32081,SUPPORT,Sounds kinda fun.,
32081,SUPPORT,I've got a bad feeling about all this...,
32081,SUPPORT,"There you go being adorable again. I don't think
that's a good idea, but thanks.",
32081,SUPPORT,"It won't be. One false move, and the walls will be
painted with blood. Still sound fun?",
32081,SUPPORT,"Same. Ever since I became boss, I've had this
nagging feeling like things are just...off.",
32081,SUPPORT,"But I certainly can't lead well by letting my feelings
get the better of me.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Better head off now. I've got people waiting for me
just outside of town. See ya around.",
32081,SUPPORT,Let me join you.,
32081,SUPPORT,...,
32081,SUPPORT,"What is it you're after? Money? Me? Or are you just
looking for someone to kill?",
32081,SUPPORT,I'm doing my diligence as a professor.,
32081,SUPPORT,I'm just curious.,
32081,SUPPORT,"You seem adamant, so...I'll allow it. Won't hurt to
have backup if things go south.",
32081,SUPPORT,"I trust you, for now. But I don't know how reliable
you actually are.",
32081,SUPPORT,"Just so we're clear, you mess with any of my people,
I'll slit your throat without hesitation. Got that?",
32082,SUPPORT,...,
32082,SUPPORT,"Hey, friend. Thanks for joining me when I had
to deal with that mess a while ago. You were a
real help.",
32082,SUPPORT,"I wouldn't say you've fully earned my trust, but...
you've earned something, for sure. I owe you.",
32082,SUPPORT,Don't worry about it.,
32082,SUPPORT,If you'd like.,
32082,SUPPORT,I can't not worry about it. I don't like owing people.,
32082,SUPPORT,Guess I'll just have to surprise you someday.,
32082,SUPPORT,"I would like. Open offer to share your desires. But if
the price is too high, I reserve my right to refuse you.",
32082,SUPPORT,Weren't you in the middle of something just now?,
32082,SUPPORT,"What is it you're doing here, anyway?",
32082,SUPPORT,"I was just rummaging through what we recovered
from the Scorpions, and I stumbled across something
pretty special to me.",
32082,SUPPORT,What's with the notebook?,
32082,SUPPORT,"It was under lock and key, so those thugs probably
thought it was something of high value.",
32082,SUPPORT,"The elder gave it to me when I was small. Losing it
really got me where it hurts...",
32082,SUPPORT,Who is this elder?,
32082,SUPPORT,Back when you were a kid?,
32082,SUPPORT,I guess it couldn't hurt to tell you about it.,
32082,SUPPORT,"Can't quite remember how old I was, but my mother
had taken in an elderly man wandering the town.",
32082,SUPPORT,"He was worse for wear—could barely even walk.
She nursed him back to health under our
humble roof.",
32082,SUPPORT,"In return for her kindly gesture, he taught me to read
and write. This notebook is a relic of those times.",
32082,SUPPORT,"Not too long after that, I came down with a
terrible illness.",
32082,SUPPORT,"We had no money to speak of, so a doctor's visit was
out of the question. My mother went everywhere
asking for help, to no avail.",
32082,SUPPORT,"And then the elder stepped in and saved me. I don't
know how he did it...or what it was he did.",
32082,SUPPORT,Maybe he was a doctor.,
32082,SUPPORT,Where is he now?,
32082,SUPPORT,"Could've been. I never knew much about him,
honestly. He could've been a mage, a scholar...
I haven't the foggiest.",
32082,SUPPORT,"And I'll never know. Shortly after curing me of my
illness, he passed on. Natural causes.",
32082,SUPPORT,"Long since passed on. Natural causes. I believe it
happened shortly after he cured me.",
32082,SUPPORT,"My illness, it turns out, was part of a larger plague
that swept through our village. So many died...",
32082,SUPPORT,"And there I was, having escaped death by some
strange luck. I felt grateful...and helpless.",
32082,SUPPORT,"So little Yuri figured it would be his mission to help
anyone he could as he grew up.",
32082,SUPPORT,Help them how?,
32082,SUPPORT,"However I could. Not necessarily by making gold
rain from the sky, but in smaller ways.",
32082,SUPPORT,"The streets are filled with kids who have no homes,
no food... So many dying of disease, where some
cheap medicine would've saved them.",
32082,SUPPORT,"I figure, if I can save even one unlucky soul, well...
then I'm doing my part, you know?",
32082,SUPPORT,"It's a small dream, but it's one I hold in my heart—to
help those who need it. It's what my gang's about.",
32082,SUPPORT,"When I recruit my people, it's to that end—to give
them a home. The turf wars, the gang, all of it...to
honor that dream.",
32082,SUPPORT,That's truly admirable.,
32082,SUPPORT,Sounds a bit outlandish to me.,
32082,SUPPORT,Just how honest are you being?,
32082,SUPPORT,"Yeah? Well, thanks. Despite what you now know
about me, I'm still the lord of the underground.
Don't go forgetting that.",
32082,SUPPORT,"Wouldn't you like to know? Despite all I've done,
I have my own honor. I don't lie to someone if I
owe them.",
32082,SUPPORT,"I do what I have to, whether people view it as fair
or foul.",
32082,SUPPORT,"The way I see things, the goddess gave me two gifts:
my life and my charm.",
32082,SUPPORT,"That's been gift enough to get in with slimy nobles
so I can pull their strings as I see fit.",
32082,SUPPORT,So you've been able to get into their good graces?,
32082,SUPPORT,So you've been using them?,
32082,SUPPORT,"Of course. It wasn't always easy, but in the end, it's
all the same little game.",
32082,SUPPORT,"Of course. I use my marionettes to help me smuggle
things, maneuver as needed... You get the idea.",
32082,SUPPORT,"Once, I used a clever name—and my charms—to
become the attendant to the head slug of a
noble house.",
32082,SUPPORT,"Yet another time, I took a name befitting the
Kingdom. That landed me in the academy as a
noble's adopted son.",
32082,SUPPORT,"That's how I've gotten this far and earned my
fortune. In doing so, I've spread my wings of
protection further, to help those who need it most.",
32082,SUPPORT,So your current name is also fake?,
32082,SUPPORT,So your current status is also false?,
32082,SUPPORT,"Heh! As though I'd tell you, friend. But perhaps you
can share what it is you think, hmm?",
32083,SUPPORT,Looks like I've got them all.,
32083,SUPPORT,Am I interrupting?,
32083,SUPPORT,What are you doing?,
32083,SUPPORT,"Nah, just wrapped up what I was doing.
Need something, friend?",
32083,SUPPORT,Just wrapped up on a task. All finished now though.,
32083,SUPPORT,Is that what you just wrapped up?,
32083,SUPPORT,"Oh, you mean this...",
32083,SUPPORT,"I use it to write down the names of everyone I've lost
over the years.",
32083,SUPPORT,"We lost a lot of lives back in the war. Some of them
were only with me a little while. Some of them were
family to me.",
32083,SUPPORT,Why do you write down their names?,
32083,SUPPORT,So what you wrote in your old notebook...,
32083,SUPPORT,"Is what I write in this one. I used the old one to
practice writing like the elder taught me, way back
when. Then I repurposed it.",
32083,SUPPORT,"Somewhere along the way, I figured I should record
the names of those I've lost. The ones I failed to
protect...",
32083,SUPPORT,"There's nothing we can do for the dead—not in this
world. Not really, anyway. And it's not like we know
what happens after.",
32083,SUPPORT,"So writing their names down here, that's all just for
me...for the one who's still around.",
32083,SUPPORT,"After all, they deserve to be remembered. Even if
they're not here to see it.",
32083,SUPPORT,"We all shared the same dream. They lost their lives
to build that dream, and as their leader, it's on me to
remember them, however I can.",
32083,SUPPORT,That's a heartfelt gesture.,
32083,SUPPORT,I can see why you might do that.,
32083,SUPPORT,"Oh you think so, do you? And here I thought I was
just a heartless villain in your eyes.",
32083,SUPPORT,"Heh. If you can see why I'd do that, then that's
something, I guess.",
32083,SUPPORT,"Well, anyway. Make of my notebook what you will.
It doesn't matter much to me.",
32083,SUPPORT,"If you go before I do, I'll make sure to add you in
here as well.",
32083,SUPPORT,You intend on putting my name in your notebook?,
32083,SUPPORT,"It's not as though I'm one of ""your people...""",
32083,SUPPORT,"You heard me. I mean, you're not exactly one of my
people, per se...",
32083,SUPPORT,"You may not be one of my people, per se...",
32083,SUPPORT,"At this point, I do have to admit that I...I can count
on you.",
32083,SUPPORT,"I kinda get the sense that if I hang around you, that
dream I've been grasping for will become all the
more real.",
32083,SUPPORT,"So do me a favor and don't go dying on me, OK?",
32083,SUPPORT,There's no need to worry.,
32083,SUPPORT,Same to you.,
32083,SUPPORT,"Heh. Certainly aren't lacking in confidence, are you?",
32083,SUPPORT,"It'd take a lot to get rid of me. I was born under a
particularly lucky star.",
32083,SUPPORT,"Hmm, cat got your tongue? Looks like you want to
say something but don't know how.",
32083,SUPPORT,"So much talk of names, and yet I don't know yours...",
32083,SUPPORT,"That again? You don't give up easy, do you?",
32083,SUPPORT,"All right, all right. I'll toss you a bone. My name's
not actually my name.",
32083,SUPPORT,"But it's the one I'm enrolled with here at the
academy. The one I've hung on to as the adoptee
of House Rowe.",
32083,SUPPORT,"Come to think of it, the last I heard someone use my
real name was...a very long time ago, from my mom.",
32083,SUPPORT,Who knows? Maybe someday I'll tell you.,
32083,SUPPORT,"Perhaps if you decide to pursue that dream alongside
me, you'll find out.",
32084,SUPPORT,"You came. I'm sure you already know where this
is headed.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Not really, no...",
32084,SUPPORT,I have no idea.,
32084,SUPPORT,"Seriously? I thought you were a little sharper
than that.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Don't toy with me, friend. Though I suppose you've
always had that tendency, haven't you?",
32084,SUPPORT,"All right, whatever. I'll get right to it.",
32084,SUPPORT,"You're the ruler of Fódlan now. That makes you the
most powerful person in the world.",
32084,SUPPORT,"You're the archbishop of the Church of Seiros now.
That's a pretty esteemed title you've got.",
32084,SUPPORT,"You're the emperor's favored subject now. That's a
pretty place you're sitting at.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Next to your brilliance, I'm not much more than a
flightless sparrow.",
32084,SUPPORT,"All I've got are my dreams, a handful of people
working for me, and a pittance of gold. Well, and
my undeniable charms, of course.",
32084,SUPPORT,"So I've got to know...is there any room in your bright
and shining world for someone like me?",
32084,SUPPORT,Of course there is.,
32084,SUPPORT,What are you really asking?,
32084,SUPPORT,"Heh. Always straight to the point with you. I should
know that by now.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Well...here we go, then. I want you to take this.
Consider it my token of thanks—a repayment for
all you've done for me—if that makes you smile.",
32084,SUPPORT,What is this a thanks for?,
32084,SUPPORT,Is this really...,
32084,SUPPORT,"Forgotten, have you? Well, I suppose it has been five
years, after all.",
32084,SUPPORT,"You backed me up when I needed some help, even
though I wouldn't admit it. Bit of a turf war, if you
recall.",
32084,SUPPORT,I don't need any thanks for that...,
32084,SUPPORT,I had forgotten all about that...,
32084,SUPPORT,I always repay what's owed. It's how I sleep at night.,
32084,SUPPORT,"But if you really don't need it, I've got another idea.",
32084,SUPPORT,"I should have expected that kind of answer from you.
I suppose we can drop the pretense entirely.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Maybe it's more of an agreement. In return for this
ring, I ask for you.",
32084,SUPPORT,Come again?,
32084,SUPPORT,Just what sort of agreement are we talking about?,
32084,SUPPORT,"Don't play coy with me. Or maybe you're just
dragging me over the coals for fun...",
32084,SUPPORT,"I can't recall how many times others have asked me
this. Being the one extending the invite... It certainly
isn't easy.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Heh. This seems a rather cruel way to treat someone
coming to you with his heart in his hands, don't
you think?",
32084,SUPPORT,But why all this? Why now?,
32084,SUPPORT,Why me?,
32084,SUPPORT,"I used to feel like saving the life of even one person
who needed it would be enough.",
32084,SUPPORT,"But I've set my sights even higher. A future in which
nobody has to die from something as awful
as poverty.",
32084,SUPPORT,"I know it's a dream worth reaching for, however
grand it might be.",
32084,SUPPORT,"And you are truly special. I feel like, together,
that dream could be made a reality.",
32084,SUPPORT,"It may never happen, but it's important to try.
Anyway, I'm just a person like anyone. I'll die, just
like anyone.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Whenever that happens, someone will have to take
over as boss. I've got that all lined up already.",
32084,SUPPORT,"And so long as my people keep living with the same
tenacity I've taught them, I've no doubt my dream
will live on. Whether or not I'm around to see to it.",
32084,SUPPORT,"My name might fade into the dust, but my dream
will remain. For the longest time, that was more
than enough...",
32084,SUPPORT,"But now I've come to want something else. When I
go, I want someone around to write my name in my
old notebook.",
32084,SUPPORT,"I can't see anyone else more suited to the task
than you.",
32084,SUPPORT,What's wrong? Did I say something strange?,
32084,SUPPORT,You're getting ahead of yourself.,
32084,SUPPORT,All this talk of you dying...,
32084,SUPPORT,"I just want to make sure things are set up properly.
You never know when it'll be my time.",
32084,SUPPORT,"Heh, I suppose I did just talk a fair bit about death
during a proposal, didn't I? Normally I'm much
more charming...",
32084,SUPPORT,"I think you get it, anyway. So? Will you accept
my offer?",
32084,SUPPORT,Before I say I do...,
32084,SUPPORT,Yeah? Something else you want?,
32084,SUPPORT,What's your real name?,
32084,SUPPORT,"Well, you certainly don't forget, huh?",
32084,SUPPORT,"I've always kept it private out of necessity. Couldn't
have such a secret being spread around, after all.",
32084,SUPPORT,"If there's anyone I'll tell, it's you. Listen closely, now.",
32085,SUPPORT,"Ah, there you are. Can we talk? I need a favor,
and you strike me as the charitable type.",
32085,SUPPORT,What do you want?,
32085,SUPPORT,This doesn't bode well.,
32085,SUPPORT,"Touchy, touchy! I'll get right to it... I need some
gold. Care to help a fella out?",
32085,SUPPORT,"Perceptive, aren't you? I know I shouldn't ask,
but I need some gold.",
32085,SUPPORT,This is a bad month for that.,
32085,SUPPORT,Out of the question.,
32085,SUPPORT,"Hard times all around, then... Well, it was worth
a shot.",
32085,SUPPORT,"Guess that debt collector traveled all the way
to Garreg Mach for nothing.",
32085,SUPPORT,"If I were you, I'd feel bad about leaving the poor
guy hanging like that, but it is what it is.",
32085,SUPPORT,You'd better work hard to pay him back.,
32085,SUPPORT,"Nah, it's a lose-lose. I owe the church too. That
means any work I do here, they take a cut.",
32085,SUPPORT,"The only way to escape my financial burden is to get
clear out of Fódlan...",
32085,SUPPORT,The thought saddens me greatly.,
32085,SUPPORT,Good luck out there.,
32085,SUPPORT,"Oh... I, uh...didn't mean to bring you down.
Y'know I was just joking, yeah?",
32085,SUPPORT,"Wow. Cold as ice. You know I was just joking, yeah?",
32085,SUPPORT,"We all have to decide where we belong and then
fight for it. Can't let your wallet control your fate.",
32085,SUPPORT,"If money was all I cared about, I never would have
walked away from inheriting a baron's house.",
32085,SUPPORT,I didn't know that about you.,
32085,SUPPORT,You don't seem very noble to me...,
32085,SUPPORT,"Eh, it's nothing. It was a minor house in the east
of the Alliance.",
32085,SUPPORT,"I hear that a lot. Still, it's true. I was the head of a
minor house in the east of the Alliance.",
32085,SUPPORT,"I like to say I stepped aside for the good of the house.
Has a nicer ring to it than saying I just wasn't cut
out for the gig. Or that I lack the right temperament.",
32085,SUPPORT,"My distinguished little bro took my place. Fact is,
he's a much better man for the job.",
32085,SUPPORT,...,
32085,SUPPORT,"Don't go feeling sorry for me now! I didn't mind one
bit. Truth is, I'd have been miserable in that life.",
32085,SUPPORT,"Having that title was nothing but fuss. Fuss is the
worst. This way of life suits me much better.",
32085,SUPPORT,And you?,
32085,SUPPORT,What about me?,
32085,SUPPORT,"You showing up at Garreg Mach was a coincidence
wrapped in happenstance.",
32085,SUPPORT,"Your pops was a renowned mercenary leader. It can
be safely assumed you'll follow in his footsteps.",
32085,SUPPORT,"But don't you ever feel like that life was decided
for you?",
32085,SUPPORT,I'm not sure I follow.,
32085,SUPPORT,You've got a point.,
32085,SUPPORT,I've never thought about it like that.,
32085,SUPPORT,"Better start pondering that one real quick, pal. Why
keep breathing if your life isn't your own, yeah?",
32085,SUPPORT,"I know. And I suggest you start choosing your fate
instead of just letting it happen. Why keep breathing
if your life isn't your own, yeah?",
32085,SUPPORT,"Welp, there's a decided lack of gold here, so I'll be
off now. You think on what I said.",
32086,SUPPORT,"Stubborn little... That's it! Nighty night, sleepyhead!",
32086,SUPPORT,Phew! Guess that's it.,
32086,SUPPORT,"Can't let lowlifes like you into Garreg Mach.
Nobody likes troublemakers. Trust me.",
32086,SUPPORT,"What the?! Oh... It's you. Don't sneak up on people.
It's rude.",
32086,SUPPORT,"But we can discuss your lacking manners another
time. Why are you here? You following me, pal?",
32086,SUPPORT,I am.,
32086,SUPPORT,That's a secret.,
32086,SUPPORT,"Guess I can't fault you for that...since you seem to
have been mopping up enemies without me
knowing it.",
32086,SUPPORT,"She really thinks I'm gonna try to reclaim my title.
Ha! She clearly doesn't know me too well.",
32086,SUPPORT,"Yet she keeps sending fools my way like the stubborn
shrew she is. That's my stepmother for ya.",
32086,SUPPORT,You haven't mentioned her before.,
32086,SUPPORT,"Shocking. Remember when I told you my little
bro inherited House Albrecht after I left?",
32086,SUPPORT,"Well, he's my half bro. And his mother is...devoted,
to say the least. She'd do anything for him.",
32086,SUPPORT,"Sadly, he had the nerve to be born without a Crest.
And here I stand with a rare one swimming in
my veins.",
32086,SUPPORT,"She's convinced I'll return one day to take back my
title by force. Completely off her rocker, that one.",
32086,SUPPORT,We can fix this.,
32086,SUPPORT,Can't you reason with her?,
32086,SUPPORT,"Nah, not worth the effort. It's best for everyone that I
take the brunt of her malice. I can handle it just fine.",
32086,SUPPORT,"Ha! If only that were humanly possible. Besides,
I refuse to concede any more than I already have.",
32086,SUPPORT,"It's best for everyone that I take the brunt of her
malice. I can handle it just fine.",
32086,SUPPORT,"If I wasn't around, she'd shift her beady gaze to my
dad. Maybe even to my mom, who fled the house
a while back.",
32086,SUPPORT,"Or maybe my little bro would become the target
of her ""good intentions."" Can't allow that to happen.",
32086,SUPPORT,That makes sense.,
32086,SUPPORT,"And that's the bottom line. Long story short...
you should keep your distance from me.",
32086,SUPPORT,"If that assassin's dagger took you out, everyone here
would fall to pieces. How would I explain that?",
32086,SUPPORT,I can protect the both of us.,
32086,SUPPORT,"That's...that's some big talk, pal. So, you'll protect
me too, will you?",
32086,SUPPORT,"To think someone who can keep up with the Exalted
King of Grappling would say such a swell thing...",
32086,SUPPORT,"I'm a betting man, so I'll take the bait. Let's see if you
really intend to protect me...or if those were just
pretty words.",
32087,SUPPORT,"I see... By any means necessary, then. Before the
war's end.",
32087,SUPPORT,"I'm covered. But just to be safe, I need you to check
on my mother and Kupala.",
32087,SUPPORT,...,
32087,SUPPORT,"Still following me, huh? We have got to work on
those manners, pal. Unless you really meant that bit
about protecting me.",
32087,SUPPORT,Who was that?,
32087,SUPPORT,Kupala?,
32087,SUPPORT,"A spy. I pay him money I don't have to monitor my
stepmother, just in case something happens to me.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Whether I'm above the dirt or below it, it's on me to
protect my mom and her home, Kupala.",
32087,SUPPORT,"That's where my mom was born and raised. I pay a
spy money I don't have to keep an eye on the place.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Whether I'm above the dirt or below it, it's up to me
to make sure my stepmother can't get to my mom.",
32087,SUPPORT,Would your stepmother really harm her?,
32087,SUPPORT,"No doubt about it. She's been honing her crazy plans
lately. All because I've taken to fighting at your side.",
32087,SUPPORT,"She thinks I'm making a name for myself before my
glorious return to House Albrecht. Being delusional
is her sport.",
32087,SUPPORT,"There's little advantage to her going after my mom,
but she's unpredictable. Gotta stay vigilant.",
32087,SUPPORT,What's your mother like?,
32087,SUPPORT,"Guess I haven't talked about her. After her and my
pops split, she returned home.",
32087,SUPPORT,Where she's from...it's kind of an odd place.,
32087,SUPPORT,"You know the folks who live in the mountains of the
Alliance? Heh, guessing that's a no. Few do.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Imagine a place with no influence to speak of,
nestled in the mountains on the Almyran border.
That's Kupala.",
32087,SUPPORT,People live there?,
32087,SUPPORT,"Well, they're not mountain goats. And it's not like
they never interact with the lords of the Alliance.",
32087,SUPPORT,"They're incredibly isolated, though. Even their trade
relations are remarkably limited.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Doubt that'll change. The land lacks resources worth
fighting over. Probably for the best, honestly.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Oh, but back to my mom. She was different.
An exception to the rule in Kupala.",
32087,SUPPORT,"She left the mountains, was rescued by my dad,
and fell madly in love with him.",
32087,SUPPORT,Sounds like destiny.,
32087,SUPPORT,Did his family accept her?,
32087,SUPPORT,"That goddess of yours is one cruel minx, so if that's
the destiny she gave 'em, it wouldn't surprise me
a bit.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Ah, the one-million-bullion question. Of course not.
He's a noble. She isn't. Acceptance was never in
the cards.",
32087,SUPPORT,"My birth helped matters, but only a little. House
Albrecht just wasn't where she belonged.",
32087,SUPPORT,"My dad was in a tough spot. He was obligated to
marry a fellow noble and produce a fitting heir.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Nobody'd want to live out their days where they're
utterly unwelcome. So my mom returned to Kupala.",
32087,SUPPORT,I see...,
32087,SUPPORT,"Then it happened. I was enrolled in the Officers
Academy at Garreg Mach, and everything changed.",
32087,SUPPORT,"During my enrollment examination, they discovered
that I bear the Major Crest of Chevalier.",
32087,SUPPORT,"My dad decided to resist his family's wishes and
make me the head of the house after I graduated.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Thing is, the truth of my special Crest was kept
a secret, by decree of the church.",
32087,SUPPORT,"He couldn't tell anyone about my prized bloodline,
so I was forced to step down as the legitimate heir.",
32087,SUPPORT,The church hid it?,
32087,SUPPORT,Why was it a secret?,
32087,SUPPORT,"It was for the best. My Crest was inherited from
mountain folk who prefer to keep to themselves.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Imagine what would happen to Kupala if it got out.
We both know it would destroy their way of life.",
32087,SUPPORT,People will do anything for a rare Crest...,
32087,SUPPORT,"Too true. I'm guessing the church thought my Crest
would cause trouble in Fódlan.",
32087,SUPPORT,"But don't get me wrong. No matter what life's
thrown at me, I'm no victim.",
32087,SUPPORT,"Like I've said, I prefer it this way. I've gotta be free.
Even if things were different, I'd still choose this life.",
32087,SUPPORT,"But I can't let my mother and her people pay the
price for keeping peace in Fódlan. Wouldn't be right.",
32087,SUPPORT,"All I can do is make a name for myself in battle and
secure enough power to protect them. Failure isn't
an option.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Hey, you! We need to talk. Now.",
32088,SUPPORT,What's wrong?,
32088,SUPPORT,"You did it for me, didn't you? Without even taking
credit for it.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Admit it, pal. You asked the emperor to protect
the people of Kupala.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Because of you, those mountains will be treated as an
independent region of the Empire.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Admit it, pal. You ordered the church to protect
the people of Kupala.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Because of you, those mountains will be considered
church turf, and the eastern church will be restored.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Admit it, pal. You asked the king to protect
the people of Kupala.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Because of you, those mountains will be considered a
self-governed dominion, like Sreng and Duscur.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Admit it, pal. You asked Claude to protect the
people of Kupala.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Relations between Fódlan and Almyra are downright
friendly now. Those mountains will be prime real
estate. They needed this.",
32088,SUPPORT,Now you know.,
32088,SUPPORT,I can't take all the credit.,
32088,SUPPORT,"I do. But you know, saving those folks was my gig.
Not yours.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Sure, sure. But you know, saving those folks was
my gig. Not yours.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Now that the war's over... Ah, I'll just spit it out.
I was starting to get excited about fighting that fight.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Guess you could say I was disappointed to find
you'd beaten me to the punch.",
32088,SUPPORT,"But what matters is results. So... Thank you. There.
I said it. Won't say it again.",
32088,SUPPORT,"There's still a lot to figure out. The road ahead won't
be easy. But this was a giant leap forward.",
32088,SUPPORT,You're welcome.,
32088,SUPPORT,"Right. There's, um, one more thing I need to get
off my chest.",
32088,SUPPORT,What's that?,
32088,SUPPORT,"Ugh... I'm a mess. I wasn't planning on doing this
just yet, but you've forced my hand.",
32088,SUPPORT,"I was going to wait until I had figured out a way to
ensure Kupala's safety first.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Guess that excuse is out the window. So now...
It's time to take the biggest gamble of my life.
I'm prepared for the worst. Expecting it, really.",
32088,SUPPORT,(Just say it already.),
32088,SUPPORT,"You... I-I... Marry me, pal!",
32088,SUPPORT,"Look, I know it's a big ask. I'm beefy, but that aside,
I'm not the most eligible bachelor on the block.",
32088,SUPPORT,"But I promise to become...better. Not so selfish and
careless. I wanna support you. Make you happy.",
32088,SUPPORT,"The life I live makes me comfortable, but... Comfort
be damned! I need you by my side. Always.",
32088,SUPPORT,"If I'm not good enough now, just give me time.
A year, maybe? Two years? Five tops.",
32088,SUPPORT,No need to wait. I love you as you are.,
32088,SUPPORT,"A year, eh?",
32088,SUPPORT,"You do?! I knew it! That seals the deal then, yeah?
Let's get hitched right away. I know a guy.",
32088,SUPPORT,"I... OK, you called my bluff.",
32088,SUPPORT,"I meant...a figurative year. I mean, why not work on
myself with you? That makes sense, I swear!",
32088,SUPPORT,Just teasing. I love you as you are now.,
32088,SUPPORT,"Phew! You had me goin' there. But...that's a promise,
yeah? To have and to hold and so on?",
32088,SUPPORT,"I'm not the sort to wait around once I know what I
want. Let's get hitched right away. I know a guy.",
32088,SUPPORT,No time like the present.,
32088,SUPPORT,"Couldn't have said it better myself. Guess a lavish
party is in order now. We have a lot to do.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Ah, speaking of lavish... I know I need to sort out my
finances. We'll need a house and all that good stuff.",
32088,SUPPORT,"Hey, maybe we can just shack up here at the
monastery. What do you think?",
32088,SUPPORT,...,
32088,SUPPORT,"Ahem. No need to decide now...my love. Let's just
focus on this ""being happy"" business. The rest'll
work itself out.",
32088,SUPPORT,"It feels like a lifetime ago, but remember when you
told me you'd protect me?",
32088,SUPPORT,"At the time, I had no idea how to take it. I wasn't
sure I could bear letting someone else look after me.",
32088,SUPPORT,"I was sure that, in the end, I'd be the one protecting
you. That I'd be the strong one. That's how it's
always been for me. Guess I was wrong...",
32088,SUPPORT,You protected me too.,
32088,SUPPORT,"Ha! Suppose so. In the end, we protected each other.",
32088,SUPPORT,"To join our strength. To look after you...and be
brave enough to let you look after me. That's what
marriage is all about, right?",
32088,SUPPORT,"Being with you is so natural, it must be fate.
Uh, you know, if fate were a thing...that is.",
32088,SUPPORT,"From now on, we'll keep looking out for each other.
You can bet on it.",
32089,SUPPORT,Oh. It's only you. Is there some reason you're here?,
32089,SUPPORT,I was just looking.,
32089,SUPPORT,Not really.,
32089,SUPPORT,"Your gaze was rather piercing for someone who
was ""just looking.""",
32089,SUPPORT,The intensity of your gaze puts the lie to that excuse.,
32089,SUPPORT,"Oh, I see now... You found yourself captivated by
my charms! Ahahaha!",
32089,SUPPORT,"This sort of thing happens all the time to those of us
blessed with such transcendent beauty.",
32089,SUPPORT,That wasn't it.,
32089,SUPPORT,"If you say so. You seem a trifle stuck on the point,
if you ask me.",
32089,SUPPORT,"Now then. You may call yourself my tutor if you
wish, and I shall attend your classes.",
32089,SUPPORT,"But none of this charade will make the idea of a
mercenary teaching me any less absurd. Aha.",
32089,SUPPORT,...,
32089,SUPPORT,"What was that look? Are you trying to convey that
I am a mere commoner, like yourself?",
32089,SUPPORT,"Well...you are correct. Think of me as a temporarily
embarrassed noble.",
32089,SUPPORT,"Even a gilded wyvern must take refuge in its cave
occasionally. But in time, it will soar free once more.",
32089,SUPPORT,"I shall fly bold and beautiful into the skies again. My
nobility and all of House Nuvelle shall be restored!",
32089,SUPPORT,Good luck.,
32089,SUPPORT,I won't hold my breath.,
32089,SUPPORT,"Luck isn't a thing that you can bestow, or that
I need. I will do this.",
32089,SUPPORT,"What insolence! You hadn't even heard what I was
going to say next.",
32089,SUPPORT,"When I restore the glory of my house, you may serve
me in some menial way. I may even pay you.",
32089,SUPPORT,"Thanks, but no thanks.",
32089,SUPPORT,An interesting proposal...,
32089,SUPPORT,"You would decline the honor of attending to me
without a second thought?",
32089,SUPPORT,"Is that the most you can say when offered such
a tantalizing prize?!",
32089,SUPPORT,"Hmph. Say whatever you like, if it makes you
feel better.",
32089,SUPPORT,It shall not sway me one way or the other. Hmhm!,
32089,SUPPORT,...,
32089,SUPPORT,"You look as though you want to say something.
Allow me to save you the effort.",
32089,SUPPORT,"If you intend to tutor me, I will require you to first
prove the time will not be wasted.",
32089,SUPPORT,"Show me not just your talent for teaching,
but your wisdom, your skill, your mettle.
Your sense of authority.",
32089,SUPPORT,"Ahaha, of course! I've been struck by my own genius!",
32089,SUPPORT,You may assist me in my research.,
32089,SUPPORT,"That ought to provide a chance for you to grasp
the extent of how magnificent I am.",
32089,SUPPORT,"It will also afford me the time I need to scrutinize
your character.",
32089,SUPPORT,"It's a plan so perfect that you can't turn it
down, huh?",
32089,SUPPORT,...,
32089,SUPPORT,Aha! Ahahaha!,
32090,SUPPORT,"Hmm... Yes, these herbs will do. Though I note
we're short on arcane crystals.",
32090,SUPPORT,I'll make a note to keep some in reserve next time.,
32090,SUPPORT,Is that everything?,
32090,SUPPORT,Will you need anything else?,
32090,SUPPORT,"Yes, that's everything. All I need now is a test
subject for the ritual.",
32090,SUPPORT,"No more materials, if that's what you're asking.
Though I do still require a test subject.",
32090,SUPPORT,A what?,
32090,SUPPORT,"Not a what, a who. Meaning you.",
32090,SUPPORT,"Now, lie still please.",
32090,SUPPORT,Does this have to happen now?,
32090,SUPPORT,"Fair point... A bit of rest to clear my head would
be good for the next steps.",
32090,SUPPORT,"Let us leave off here, and I shall see you again in the
morning.",
32090,SUPPORT,"There's no talking you out of this, is there?",
32090,SUPPORT,I don't want to be a test subject...,
32090,SUPPORT,"I'd better make some headway on this tomorrow.
Every day counts, you know.",
32090,SUPPORT,"If I can complete this ritual, I'll be famous
throughout the known world for it! Ahaha!",
32090,SUPPORT,Why do all of this?,
32090,SUPPORT,"The prestige it will bring me is necessary to restore
my fallen house.",
32090,SUPPORT,"Or was your question, ""Why go to so much trouble
for a fallen house?""",
32090,SUPPORT,Because I am a Nuvelle! As were all my ancestors!,
32090,SUPPORT,And our line has endured too long to end with me.,
32090,SUPPORT,Why would it end with you?,
32090,SUPPORT,"Oh, yes... You don't know.",
32090,SUPPORT,"Well, seeing as you are serving both as my research
assistant and test subject, I should explain myself.",
32090,SUPPORT,"House Nuvelle was granted its peerage shortly after
the establishment of the Empire.",
32090,SUPPORT,"For generations, the heads of our house have been
scholars of magic. They often enjoyed appointments
to esteemed posts within the Empire.",
32090,SUPPORT,"However, during the Insurrection of the Seven, we
cast our lot with the emperor and were punished
for it.",
32090,SUPPORT,"We suffered further losses when we were used as a
sacrifice to Dagda and Brigid during their attack.",
32090,SUPPORT,"My family, including my parents and older brother,
died then. The town of Nuvelle is now an ash heap.",
32090,SUPPORT,"The six great families decreed this to be the end of
my house. We have naught left now but the name.",
32090,SUPPORT,"No title, no subjects, no land... Everything I was
to inherit has been taken from me.",
32090,SUPPORT,I see...,
32090,SUPPORT,"What I require is an achievement so grand that
Lady Edelgard would be forced to recognize it.",
32090,SUPPORT,"What I require is an achievement so grand that our
next ruler would be forced to recognize it.",
32090,SUPPORT,"And then House Nuvelle will take its rightful
place among the elite class once more!",
32090,SUPPORT,Now I understand.,
32090,SUPPORT,"You understand that to collaborate with me toward
such a grand purpose is a high honor, don't you?",
32090,SUPPORT,"...But yes, good night. I expect to see you bright and
early tomorrow.",
32091,SUPPORT,Ah! Another failure!,
32091,SUPPORT,How?! Was there an error in my calculations?,
32091,SUPPORT,"I had precious few materials as things stood!
Where will I get more once these run out?",
32091,SUPPORT,I'm really sorry...,
32091,SUPPORT,"Oh, don't act so rueful.",
32091,SUPPORT,"You carried out my directions faithfully. Neither
the credit nor the blame ought to be yours.",
32091,SUPPORT,"My grand achievement is further away than I had
hoped... House Nuvelle's future seems so dim.",
32091,SUPPORT,You shouldn't lose hope.,
32091,SUPPORT,Keep trying. You'll get it.,
32091,SUPPORT,...,
32091,SUPPORT,"You're correct, of course. I mustn't be discouraged.",
32091,SUPPORT,It is hard to maintain one's patience after five years.,
32091,SUPPORT,"But in the greater context of the history of House
Nuvelle, five years is barely worth counting!",
32091,SUPPORT,That's the spirit.,
32091,SUPPORT,"I have been in a low place indeed to require so
much reassurance...",
32091,SUPPORT,"And for your reassurance, I am truly grateful. You
have spurred me to continue my research.",
32091,SUPPORT,"You've been useful to me in many ways, in fact.
Research assistant...confidant...test subject...",
32091,SUPPORT,"All of this is preparing you well for your greater
role to come.",
32091,SUPPORT,Which is...,
32091,SUPPORT,"My personal attendant! There are few as naturally
servile as you in all of Fódlan.",
32091,SUPPORT,"When House Nuvelle is at long last restored, we
simply must find a proper position for you.",
32091,SUPPORT,...,
32091,SUPPORT,"Granted, this will be difficult—perhaps even
impossible—to accept, given your current status.",
32091,SUPPORT,But I rarely let the impossible stop me!,
32091,SUPPORT,"I shall see it all done—the restoration of my house,
installing you as my servant, and more!",
32091,SUPPORT,Are you ready for the next steps? Ahaha!,
32091,SUPPORT,...I'm glad you've perked up.,
32091,SUPPORT,"Oh, come now. My sulk ended minutes ago.
Do keep up.",
32091,SUPPORT,"But on the rare occasion that I find myself at a loss,
I grant you permission to lift my spirits.",
32091,SUPPORT,I see.,
32091,SUPPORT,Sure.,
32091,SUPPORT,Of course.,
32091,SUPPORT,"I don't know that I care for the hint of resignation
in your tone, but no matter.",
32091,SUPPORT,"I expect you to do your all for the sake of my house,
nonetheless!",
32091,SUPPORT,Ahahaha!,
32092,SUPPORT,"You're late. Did you intend to keep me waiting for
so long?",
32092,SUPPORT,Things came up.,
32092,SUPPORT,"Yes, I suppose your position is rather demanding.",
32092,SUPPORT,But you really must get your priorities in order.,
32092,SUPPORT,"The moment has come. All these years of research
shall finally bear fruit! Ahaha!",
32092,SUPPORT,"Ahem... But first, a request.",
32092,SUPPORT,What is it?,
32092,SUPPORT,You must marry me!,
32092,SUPPORT,"I've given this quite a bit of thought. It satisfies me
to have come up with a way to be with you always.",
32092,SUPPORT,"For the ruler of the new unified Fódlan to become
my personal attendant might seem a step down.",
32092,SUPPORT,"For such a major figure in the unification to become
my personal attendant might seem a step down.",
32092,SUPPORT,"For the new archbishop to become my personal
attendant might seem a step down.",
32092,SUPPORT,"However, if we were to be wed, you would have
to stay close to me.",
32092,SUPPORT,"A perfect plan, wouldn't you agree?",
32092,SUPPORT,You're serious about this?,
32092,SUPPORT,I'm only a step in your plan?,
32092,SUPPORT,Was I unclear?,
32092,SUPPORT,"I want us to be together for life. That is the
definition of marriage!",
32092,SUPPORT,My love for you won't stand for anything less.,
32092,SUPPORT,"No, not at all! You misunderstand me! I want a real
marriage, not a political sham!",
32092,SUPPORT,"I want us to be together for life. My love for you
won't stand for anything less.",
32092,SUPPORT,It won't have to.,
32092,SUPPORT,...,
32092,SUPPORT,Oh!,
32092,SUPPORT,You came prepared with a ring!,
32092,SUPPORT,"Which means we think alike already—we were
destined to be together!",
32092,SUPPORT,Seems that way.,
32092,SUPPORT,"And it is together that we shall work to restore
House Nuvelle.",
32092,SUPPORT,"You have no issue with living on House Nuvelle's
former land, I trust?",
32092,SUPPORT,"Or would it pose difficulties for one in your position
to move to the western edge of Fódlan?",
32092,SUPPORT,"Ah, but that is a detail which can be settled later.
Let us act now on what matters!",
32092,SUPPORT,"Pardon my intrusion, but something alarming
has happened!",
32092,SUPPORT,"It seems to have started around the Goddess Tower,
but it's spread throughout the cathedral now!
A wave of flowers is—",
32092,SUPPORT,"Oh, uh, please excuse me. I can see you're busy.",
32092,SUPPORT,It is my fiancé's magic at work.,
32092,SUPPORT,Ah! I should have real...ized...,
32092,SUPPORT,"Her magic?! Your fiancé?! S-since when were
you engaged?!",
32092,SUPPORT,His...fiancé...,
32092,SUPPORT,"Well, congratulations in that case!",
32092,SUPPORT,"If that's all this is, then I'll let the others know
to stand down!",
32092,SUPPORT,"My dearest! You must warn me next time before
tossing around such charged language.",
32092,SUPPORT,What?,
32092,SUPPORT,"What you called me. Oh, I'm all aflutter! I can't tell
whether this is delight or embarrassment!",
32092,SUPPORT,"Regardless, I shall consider it to be fair play.",
32092,SUPPORT,"I haven't felt my spirits lifted so since the last time
I made a breakthrough in my research!",
32092,SUPPORT,Speaking of which...,
32092,SUPPORT,"Hm? Oh! Do you suppose that piece of spellcraft
will suffice to see my house restored?",
32092,SUPPORT,"It surely qualifies as a grand achivement, yes?
One that shall go down in history!",
32092,SUPPORT,"As for what other purpose it might serve, I leave that
up to you.",
32092,SUPPORT,"You won't object to that, I take it? After all, you
can't refuse a request from your darling fiancé!",
32092,SUPPORT,Ahaha! Ahahaha!,
32093,SUPPORT,"Well, look who it is. How are you, Chatterbox?
Gotten the hang of the whole teaching thing yet?",
32093,SUPPORT,I would say so.,
32093,SUPPORT,"Not really, no.",
32093,SUPPORT,"That makes sense. You certainly strut around here
like someone who belongs.",
32093,SUPPORT,"Oh, you're still finding your footing? That's not
really the impression I got.",
32093,SUPPORT,"You seem like one of those people who blends in.
I could see you just about anywhere and think,
""Oh, that person's here. Makes sense.""",
32093,SUPPORT,Um. Thanks?,
32093,SUPPORT,"I wasn't paying you some sort of compliment.
To me, it doesn't matter whether or not you believe
in the goddess.",
32093,SUPPORT,"You're here supporting the church, and that makes
you no different from the others. I can't stand that.",
32093,SUPPORT,Sorry about that.,
32093,SUPPORT,"No need to apologize. I just have a rocky history
with the church, is all.",
32093,SUPPORT,"They betrayed me, or at any rate, horribly mistreated
me.",
32093,SUPPORT,So I'm not a huge fan. But keep that to yourself.,
32093,SUPPORT,You were mistreated?,
32093,SUPPORT,You were betrayed?,
32093,SUPPORT,"When I was little, a lady locked me up and held me
captive for a long time.",
32093,SUPPORT,"The Knights of Seiros rescued me—promised to
protect me. But then they hid me away in Abyss.",
32093,SUPPORT,"So all the knights did was move me from one cage
to another. Wouldn't you call that mistreatment?",
32093,SUPPORT,"So all the knights did was move me from one cage
to another. Wouldn't you call that a betrayal?",
32093,SUPPORT,"It was all for the greater good. They didn't want to
put anyone important in danger.",
32093,SUPPORT,"As for me, my life was expendable.",
32093,SUPPORT,"That guy Alois was nice to me, though. And he told
me a bunch of hilarious jokes to cheer me up.",
32093,SUPPORT,Sounds like him.,
32093,SUPPORT,...Hilarious?,
32093,SUPPORT,"I was being sarcastic. Alois wouldn't know a good
joke if it landed in his mustache.",
32093,SUPPORT,"Do they not have sarcasm where you come from?
Keep up.",
32093,SUPPORT,"Anyway, that's why I hate the church.",
32093,SUPPORT,"Someday you'll hate them too. They only hired you
because they needed a warm body to fill the post.",
32093,SUPPORT,"When you're of no use to them, they'll get rid of you
without a second thought.",
32093,SUPPORT,...,
32093,SUPPORT,"Sorry, that sounded more menacing than I intended.
I'm just telling you how these people think.",
32093,SUPPORT,"They have rules, dogma. They want us all bound to
their system so they can control us.",
32093,SUPPORT,"I don't do well with that sort of stuff. That's why I
ran away from home in the first place.",
32093,SUPPORT,Ran away?,
32093,SUPPORT,"Yeah. Ran far, far away. But as far as I ran, it wasn't
far enough. I got dragged back into society, chains
and all.",
32093,SUPPORT,The kind of world I want doesn't exist.,
32093,SUPPORT,...,
32093,SUPPORT,I don't think that's true.,
32093,SUPPORT,"I'm getting too dark for you, aren't I? Forget I said
anything.",
32093,SUPPORT,"Your future seems bright, at least. You can just sit
back and enjoy whatever comes your way.",
32093,SUPPORT,"I'm just saying, don't rest your entire future on the
church. It's not as steady a foundation as it seems.",
32093,SUPPORT,"Anyway, that's all. I'll be going now.",
32094,SUPPORT,"Oh, Chatterbox, it's you. Do you need this room for
something? Should I leave?",
32094,SUPPORT,Why would you leave?,
32094,SUPPORT,You can stay.,
32094,SUPPORT,"What do you mean? With me here, you won't be
able to focus on whatever you're doing.",
32094,SUPPORT,"Are you...sure? With me here, you won't be able to
focus on whatever you're doing.",
32094,SUPPORT,I'll be fine. Just stay.,
32094,SUPPORT,"All right...if you're sure. You're a strange one,
you know that?",
32094,SUPPORT,"When I came in earlier, people couldn't leave fast
enough. They ran away like I was a bad smell.",
32094,SUPPORT,"I should be used to that sort of thing by now, but...
Well, it stung a little bit.",
32094,SUPPORT,That's terrible.,
32094,SUPPORT,Why would they leave?,
32094,SUPPORT,"I almost don't blame them. Everyone must have
heard the rumors by now.",
32094,SUPPORT,"Are you making fun of me? I'm sure you've heard the
rumors, just like everyone else.",
32094,SUPPORT,"A girl who summons monsters when she sighs. That's
not the kind of thing people keep to themselves.",
32094,SUPPORT,"Anyway, I prefer solitude. It's easier that way.",
32094,SUPPORT,Are the rumors true?,
32094,SUPPORT,"You really didn't know? Yeah, the rumors are true
as heck.",
32094,SUPPORT,That's why the knights stuck me in Abyss.,
32094,SUPPORT,"If anything was going to happen, better down there
than up here. That was the idea, anyway.",
32094,SUPPORT,I see...,
32094,SUPPORT,"Oh, you had that look on your face. The ""yikes, get
this creep away from me"" look. It's OK, I'll leave.",
32094,SUPPORT,"Look how dangerous I am, after all. You wouldn't
want to be left alone with someone like me.",
32094,SUPPORT,"Who knows? Maybe I'll get exasperated, and without
thinking, I'll start to— Huuuh...",
32094,SUPPORT,...,
32094,SUPPORT,...aaaahhhh...,
32094,SUPPORT,It was just a yawn. That's a relief.,
32094,SUPPORT,"Sorry to scare you, Chatterbox. I don't usually
do that.",
32094,SUPPORT,Guess I haven't been getting enough sleep.,
32094,SUPPORT,"Everybody talking about me like I'm some freak...
It's been bothering me.",
32094,SUPPORT,You're worrying me.,
32094,SUPPORT,"It doesn't matter. Gossip is petty and a waste of
energy, so there's no need for me to pay it any mind.",
32094,SUPPORT,Still...,
32094,SUPPORT,"The funny thing is all this drama has made me more
likely to lose my cool. If that happens, you'll help me
out, right?",
32094,SUPPORT,I'll do what I can.,
32095,SUPPORT,"Oh, hey. I've been meaning to speak with you.",
32095,SUPPORT,What about?,
32095,SUPPORT,"I heard that you've been telling people not to worry
so much about my condition.",
32095,SUPPORT,Is that a fact?,
32095,SUPPORT,...Maybe.,
32095,SUPPORT,"No need to be coy. Thanks for doing that. But I do
have one minor concern...",
32095,SUPPORT,"You said that I haven't sighed in five years?!
What the heck is that about? Everyone's calling me
""Half-Decade Hapi"" now!",
32095,SUPPORT,"First of all, terrible nickname. Second of all, you
weren't even here. Did you just make that up?",
32095,SUPPORT,"No, I asked around.",
32095,SUPPORT,...Maybe.,
32095,SUPPORT,"You asked around?! That's such a weird thing to do.
I'm fighting the urge to sigh right now!",
32095,SUPPORT,Seriously?! You think that's OK?,
32095,SUPPORT,"That's so frustrating. I'm fighting the urge to sigh
right now!",
32095,SUPPORT,I thought I was helping...,
32095,SUPPORT,"Well, the nickname's bogus. I have absolutely sighed
in the last five years.",
32095,SUPPORT,"You wouldn't believe what a hassle it was. Monsters
rampaging willy-nilly through Abyss.",
32095,SUPPORT,"Thanks to some help from the people underground,
no one got hurt, but it was a close call.",
32095,SUPPORT,"There were soldiers there to fight them off, so no one
got hurt, but it was a close call.",
32095,SUPPORT,"Maybe if you had been there, it wouldn't have been
so much trouble.",
32095,SUPPORT,Me?,
32095,SUPPORT,"Yes, you. You've got the Sword of the Creator. That
thing can chop through monsters like nothing.",
32095,SUPPORT,Is that all?,
32095,SUPPORT,"Are you fishing for compliments now? Fine. You're a
good leader. You watch out for all of us.",
32095,SUPPORT,"Even when the rest of the world turns and hides
from me, I know you've got my back.",
32095,SUPPORT,That's true.,
32095,SUPPORT,You make me feel safe. Like I can be myself.,
32095,SUPPORT,"Like I don't have to worry so much about keeping
my emotions in check.",
32095,SUPPORT,I felt pretty sad all that time you were gone.,
32095,SUPPORT,"I could've left Garreg Mach altogether. But then I
started thinking...you might still be alive, after all.",
32095,SUPPORT,"So I went looking for you. Back to where you'd
fallen and all.",
32095,SUPPORT,You did that for me?,
32095,SUPPORT,"You really care about me, huh?",
32095,SUPPORT,"Ugh! Forget I said anything. Look at me getting all
mushy and sincere.",
32095,SUPPORT,"How embarrassing. Let's just go back to earlier when
I was giving you a hard time.",
32095,SUPPORT,Don't be embarrassed.,
32095,SUPPORT,"Hey, I can feel embarrassed if I want to! I can feel
however I wanna feel!",
32095,SUPPORT,Whoa. Did I really just say that?,
32095,SUPPORT,"I think that's enough vulnerability for one day. I'll
see you around.",
32096,SUPPORT,"This is quite a place. Whatever you wanted to tell
me must be pretty important.",
32096,SUPPORT,It is.,
32096,SUPPORT,"OK, what's going on? You're making a weird face.
It's freaking me out.",
32096,SUPPORT,"You're going to be the new archbishop, right?
Let's talk about that.",
32096,SUPPORT,"You're going to rule over all of Fódlan, right?
Let's talk about that.",
32096,SUPPORT,"The church and the Knights of Seiros are being
dissolved, right? Let's talk about that.",
32096,SUPPORT,"Good riddance, as far as I'm concerned.",
32096,SUPPORT,"Yes, but...",
32096,SUPPORT,"This is a chance to replace the old, hollow Church of
Seiros with something new—something better.",
32096,SUPPORT,"In your new position, you can make that happen.",
32096,SUPPORT,I can certainly try.,
32096,SUPPORT,Then do it!,
32096,SUPPORT,"Those hypocrites preached about love and decency
while shoving folks like me into the shadows.",
32096,SUPPORT,"That's a pretty shoddy religion in my book. You can
reshape it into something that actually helps people.",
32096,SUPPORT,"Not that I need any help, mind you. I can help
myself just fine.",
32096,SUPPORT,That's true.,
32096,SUPPORT,"Oh, there's another thing I meant to talk to you
about. It's, um...um...",
32096,SUPPORT,I have something urgent to discuss.,
32096,SUPPORT,Stop trying to derail the conversation.,
32096,SUPPORT,"I know! I'm just nervous, OK?",
32096,SUPPORT,"You figured me out! I'm just nervous, OK?",
32096,SUPPORT,Say whatever you're going to say.,
32096,SUPPORT,I have something for you.,
32096,SUPPORT,I knew you were going to do that. I just knew it.,
32096,SUPPORT,"OK, let me tell you why this is a bad idea.",
32096,SUPPORT,Um... Go ahead.,
32096,SUPPORT,"You know that I'll always be coping with this...
condition. This curse. It'll always be a part of my life.",
32096,SUPPORT,"I feel safe with you, but you'll never feel the same
with me.",
32096,SUPPORT,"I'm not the kind of person you should get a cat with.
Unless you want your cat to be eaten by monsters.",
32096,SUPPORT,Have you thought about all that?,
32096,SUPPORT,I know you care about me. I care about you too.,
32096,SUPPORT,"I wish we could spend our lives together. But...it just
wouldn't be right.",
32096,SUPPORT,"I can't let you throw away your own happiness for
my sake.",
32096,SUPPORT,"Actually, Hapi...",
32096,SUPPORT,"Hold on. You're saying that you imbued this ring
with magic?",
32096,SUPPORT,An enchantment that wards off monsters...,
32096,SUPPORT,So... It negates my curse? I'm free?!,
32096,SUPPORT,You're free.,
32096,SUPPORT,"Hang on. That means you weren't really proposing.
And here I am, talking about getting a cat together.",
32096,SUPPORT,"I almost wish a monster would appear just to save me
from the embarrassment.",
32096,SUPPORT,Hapi. Will you marry me?,
32096,SUPPORT,"Oh, come on! I can't handle all this will-we-won't-we
stuff. My heart's going to pop out of my chest.",
32096,SUPPORT,...,
32096,SUPPORT,"All right. Thank you for giving me a second to
collect myself.",
32096,SUPPORT,"Yes, you weirdo. Of course I'll marry you.",
32096,SUPPORT,I'm so happy.,
32096,SUPPORT,"Me too. Well, obviously I'm Hapi, but I'm also...
you know what I mean.",
32096,SUPPORT,"I appreciate everything you've done for me. You've
changed my life in more ways than one.",
32096,SUPPORT,"It's hard not to fall for someone like that. Though,
of course, I've had a crush on you from the get-go...",
32096,SUPPORT,"Oh, forget I said that! I'm all over the place.",
32096,SUPPORT,"We don't know what the future has in store for
us, but...",
32096,SUPPORT,"For now, maybe we can forget all that and just enjoy
being together.",
32096,SUPPORT,Of course.,
32096,SUPPORT,Only for a little while.,
32096,SUPPORT,"Good. After all, we've worked so hard to get here.",
32096,SUPPORT,We've worked so hard to get here. Don't rush me.,
32096,SUPPORT,"Come closer, will you?",
32096,SUPPORT,*sigh*,
32096,SUPPORT,*siiigh*,
32096,SUPPORT,"Damn, that felt good.",
32097,SUPPORT,I never imagined I'd see you again.,
32097,SUPPORT,Indeed...,
32097,SUPPORT,"Emile, I've missed you so much. How long has it
been since we last spoke?",
32097,SUPPORT,Since you left House Bartels. I was eight.,
32097,SUPPORT,And just look at you now! All grown up.,
32097,SUPPORT,"I notice that you still indulge in sweets. It makes me
happy to see that you're still the same in some ways.",
32097,SUPPORT,"Hm... It has been some time since I've tasted such
a thing...",
32097,SUPPORT,"Well, of course. That's because this is a recipe only
Mother and I know of.",
32097,SUPPORT,"Oh no! You've gotten crumbs all over your face.
Sit still while I wipe them off.",
32097,SUPPORT,Stop it.,
32097,SUPPORT,"Oh, come on. Allow me to be your big sis. It won't
hurt you to indulge me.",
32097,SUPPORT,"Mercedes. The little brother you once loved... He is
no longer here.",
32097,SUPPORT,"It doesn't matter to me how you've changed. You
will always be my baby brother.",
32097,SUPPORT,You are precious to both me and to Mother.,
32097,SUPPORT,"Mother is well, I assume...",
32097,SUPPORT,"She is very well! You should send her a letter.
She'd be so thrilled!",
32097,SUPPORT,I suppose.,
32097,SUPPORT,"Mother has always borne a deep regret over what
happened. We should have brought you with us...",
32097,SUPPORT,"We never intended to leave you alone with
House Bartels.",
32097,SUPPORT,"Perhaps not. But it was wise of Mother to have only
taken you.",
32097,SUPPORT,"As the heir, if she had taken me, Father would have
searched relentlessly for us all.",
32097,SUPPORT,"And...had he found us...I feel certain he'd have killed
you both.",
32097,SUPPORT,"Yes... That's what Mother said too. He'd have done
exactly that.",
32097,SUPPORT,"You know, I've heard about what happened... About
killing the family of House Bartels.",
32097,SUPPORT,And? Are you afraid of me? Or...do you despise me?,
32097,SUPPORT,Neither of those. That isn't why I bring this up.,
32097,SUPPORT,"I understand your reasons, but it's a terrible thing to
take a life. You understood that even then.",
32097,SUPPORT,"I've been waiting a very long time to ask you. Why
did you do it? Why did you kill your father?",
32097,SUPPORT,Because I wanted to.,
32097,SUPPORT,"I know you're avoiding my question. I can hear it
in your voice.",
32097,SUPPORT,"I won't ask any further if you don't want to tell me
why. But...just let me know if you ever feel ready to
talk to me about it.",
32097,SUPPORT,Understood. The time may eventually come.,
32097,SUPPORT,"Until then, I'll wait patiently.",
32098,SUPPORT,"Hello, Emile. The war council is about to begin—
come on!",
32098,SUPPORT,...,
32098,SUPPORT,"What's the matter? You're so pale... Have you
been injured?",
32098,SUPPORT,...,
32098,SUPPORT,Emile?,
32098,SUPPORT,Ah!,
32098,SUPPORT,Must...slay...more...,
32098,SUPPORT,What?,
32098,SUPPORT,"There is no pleasure to be had in these halls...
My thirst is unbearable...",
32098,SUPPORT,Perhaps bathing in your blood will help satiate me...,
32098,SUPPORT,"Emile? Wait... You...you're not Emile. You're the
Death Knight.",
32098,SUPPORT,"You may look like him, but you are not him.
He would never say such a thing.",
32098,SUPPORT,"What care I for names? I care only to kill or
be killed.",
32098,SUPPORT,"I see. So you want to kill me? Then do as you must—
it is within your rights.",
32098,SUPPORT,My...rights?,
32098,SUPPORT,"Mother and I must be the reason the Death Knight
exists within you.",
32098,SUPPORT,"A young boy left all alone in House Bartels without
us... I can't imagine how lonely and terrible that
must have been.",
32098,SUPPORT,"To our half-siblings who bore no Crests, we were
nothing more than...intruders.",
32098,SUPPORT,"Their horrible words and violent actions were only
bearable because the three of us supported one
another through it...",
32098,SUPPORT,"All alone in a place like that... It's little wonder that
you broke down as you have.",
32098,SUPPORT,"We should have rescued you. We should have
offered ourselves to save you.",
32098,SUPPORT,Nonsense...,
32098,SUPPORT,"However, we cannot turn back the hands of time.
Atonement is all I have for you now.",
32098,SUPPORT,You don't understand anything...,
32098,SUPPORT,Emile?,
32098,SUPPORT,"The day you left, 18 years ago...I told Mother
to leave me there.",
32098,SUPPORT,Wh-what? But why did you do such a thing?,
32098,SUPPORT,I...wanted to protect you.,
32098,SUPPORT,"I am glad that we are reunited. I am happy that you
are alive.",
32098,SUPPORT,"I... I am so sorry, my dear sister.",
32098,SUPPORT,Emile...,
32099,SUPPORT,"You trust too much. Allowing someone who has
turned their blade on you to come near...",
32099,SUPPORT,"Because there are two sides to you, you fear that
I endanger myself?",
32099,SUPPORT,I am nothing more than a merciless killer.,
32099,SUPPORT,"A demon whose only pleasure is found within
death's shadow.",
32099,SUPPORT,"Such a creature should not be allowed near you,
dear sister.",
32099,SUPPORT,"Just what are you implying, Emile?",
32099,SUPPORT,"I have come to bid you farewell. Today, I will leave
the monastery for good.",
32099,SUPPORT,"If I stay, it is only a matter of time before I hurt you.
Just like I did those in House Bartels.",
32099,SUPPORT,You can't leave...,
32099,SUPPORT,"But if it must be so, then answer me this before you
depart. Why did you kill your father?",
32099,SUPPORT,...,
32099,SUPPORT,"On the day I took his life, Father had just discovered
that you and Mother were hiding at a church in
the Kingdom.",
32099,SUPPORT,"He was considering bringing both of you back
home, but by then, Mother was past the age to
bear children.",
32099,SUPPORT,"And so he proclaimed that he would take the only
other female of the Lamine bloodline... That he
would take you as his wife.",
32099,SUPPORT,"What happened after that...I remember nothing of
it. How I killed him or what his final words were.",
32099,SUPPORT,You... You did it for me. To protect me...,
32099,SUPPORT,"Regardless of reasons, a demon is a demon. I have
said enough.",
32099,SUPPORT,Hold on! That isn't fair!,
32099,SUPPORT,Not fair?,
32099,SUPPORT,"No! You can't just tell me all of that and then
vanish forever.",
32099,SUPPORT,"Please stay. At least until this horrible war meets its
end. I want you around just a while longer...",
32099,SUPPORT,But...all that I do results in harm to others...,
32099,SUPPORT,"You saw it yourself. The demon that lives within
bares his fangs indiscriminately.",
32099,SUPPORT,"You...know all of this, and still you wish for me
to remain?",
32099,SUPPORT,"Even if I am hurt—or worse yet, killed—if it is by
your hand, then I will find peace.",
32099,SUPPORT,"I am and will always be your big sister, Emile.",
32099,SUPPORT,"Mercedes, I...",
32099,SUPPORT,"I love you, Emile. That never changes. Understand?",
32099,SUPPORT,I understand...,
32099,SUPPORT,"Then...I will remain here a while longer. Until we
see this war through, I will remain by your side.",
32101,SUPPORT,...,
32101,SUPPORT,Aaaah!,
32101,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32101,SUPPORT,Ah... Aaaah!,
32101,SUPPORT,Hm? Huh? Ugh... I must've had a nightmare...,
32101,SUPPORT,You're awake.,
32101,SUPPORT,"Aaaah! I mean, um...um...uuuh! Yeh... Yuh...
Yooo...",
32101,SUPPORT,Jeritza.,
32101,SUPPORT,"Uh, yeah! That's it. Professor Jeritza!",
32101,SUPPORT,I'm not a professor.,
32101,SUPPORT,"Wait, what? You're not Professor Jeritza?!",
32101,SUPPORT,"Oh, yeah! Professor Jeritza always wears a mask.
So then... Uh... Who are you?",
32101,SUPPORT,Jeritza.,
32101,SUPPORT,Uh... I don't understand!,
32101,SUPPORT,"Look... Are you Professor Jeritza, or aren't you?
Please, make yourself clear!",
32101,SUPPORT,"I am Jeritza, but I am not a professor.",
32101,SUPPORT,"A Jeritza who is not a professor... So there are two
Jeritzas running around the Monastery?",
32101,SUPPORT,...,
32101,SUPPORT,"Oh, wait... Ah! Aha! I got it. I get it now!",
32101,SUPPORT,"You're no longer a professor, therefore you're just
Jeritza. Plain old Jeritza.",
32101,SUPPORT,"Our professor isn't a professor anymore, either, but
doesn't mind the title.",
32101,SUPPORT,"I guess I figured you'd be fine with being called
professor as well.",
32101,SUPPORT,"When I was teaching, it was simply a task. Nothing
more.",
32101,SUPPORT,"I don't really get it, but it sounds like there's a lot
going on in that skull of yours, Jeritza.",
32101,SUPPORT,"Oh, Bernie, what the heck are you even doing in the
infirmary?",
32101,SUPPORT,You took one look at me and passed out.,
32101,SUPPORT,"Huh? Don't be silly. There's absolutely no reason I'd
faint at the sight of you, Jeritz—",
32101,SUPPORT,...,
32101,SUPPORT,"I... Uh... Uh! I'm coming down with a sudden cold, 
I think. Yeah! I've...uh...gotta run to my room!",
32102,SUPPORT,Jeritza?,
32102,SUPPORT,What.,
32102,SUPPORT,"Heh heh, I've got it all figured out.",
32102,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32102,SUPPORT,Your true identity!,
32102,SUPPORT,Hmm...,
32102,SUPPORT,"If my detective skills are correct, then you...are...",
32102,SUPPORT,The Death Knight! ...Right?!,
32102,SUPPORT,Everyone already knows that.,
32102,SUPPORT,Huh? What? Everyone knows? But...how?!,
32102,SUPPORT,"Ugh, and here I thought that I had uncovered your
big, spooky secret.",
32102,SUPPORT,"Oh, Bernie...you're such a shut-in that you missed
the biggest news in town...",
32102,SUPPORT,...,
32102,SUPPORT,"So here's the deal, Jeritza. You've gotta tell me a
secret about you that nobody else knows.",
32102,SUPPORT,Why?,
32102,SUPPORT,"Because! I sleuthed for hours upon hours! That's
gotta be rewarded!",
32102,SUPPORT,Just stop.,
32102,SUPPORT,"Aw, come on. Please? Oh, oh! I know! I've got it!",
32102,SUPPORT,"Why do you wear that crazy-looking armor when
you're pretending to be the Death Knight?",
32102,SUPPORT,"Are you just into the look of it? You like spooky
stuff?",
32102,SUPPORT,Well...,
32102,SUPPORT,"I may have been drawn to that aspect. To look
sinister. To embody death.",
32102,SUPPORT,"Oh, I see!",
32102,SUPPORT,"I thought, maybe you put on that mask and armor
because, just like ol' Bernie, you don't like talking
to people.",
32102,SUPPORT,...,
32102,SUPPORT,Heh heh...,
32102,SUPPORT,"There may be some truth to that. Talking to people
is intolerable.",
32102,SUPPORT,"Oh yeah?! I think I'm sensing a real kinship
between us!",
32102,SUPPORT,"So with that whole spooky getup on, it allowed you
to speak to people with confidence!",
32102,SUPPORT,No...,
32102,SUPPORT,"Oh, hey, Jeritza? Don't tell anyone about this, OK?",
32102,SUPPORT,This is our little secret!,
32102,SUPPORT,"I don't mind, but...I also don't understand.",
32103,SUPPORT,"Lately, I've noticed that our lunch times seem to
coincide with one another's, and I—",
32103,SUPPORT,"Oh no! Am I bothering you? I am, aren't I? I knew
you were getting too carried away, Bernie!",
32103,SUPPORT,"I mean, it's no wonder you don't wanna have lunch
with me anymore. Just having me around probably
makes your food taste awful...",
32103,SUPPORT,"My food tastes the same as it always does. I was
merely stating a fact about our lunches coinciding.",
32103,SUPPORT,Oh...,
32103,SUPPORT,"But I am curious as to why you want to eat with me.
It isn't that you—",
32103,SUPPORT,Aaah! Please forgive me!,
32103,SUPPORT,I am so sorry I've been using you to avoid people!,
32103,SUPPORT,"The truth is, hardly anyone ever comes near us, and
it's been such a relief!",
32103,SUPPORT,"That's it? Well, then. I don't mind.",
32103,SUPPORT,Huh? You...don't?,
32103,SUPPORT,"When last we spoke, you mentioned feeling a kinship
to me...",
32103,SUPPORT,"So I wondered if you were thinking that we may be...
kindred spirits, of a sort.",
32103,SUPPORT,Oh? Uh... Hmm... I...,
32103,SUPPORT,"I mean, of course not, Jeritza! I didn't mean anything
like that at all! Ha! Kindred spirits?! Us?! Ha...ha...
Haaa...",
32103,SUPPORT,"But I mean... Totally hypothetical here, but, uh...
If I did think we were kindred spirits, would...uh...
there be a problem with that?",
32103,SUPPORT,"Yes. There would. The reason I dislike people...is
because if I don't keep my distance, it is only a
matter of time before I kill them.",
32103,SUPPORT,"If you continue spending time near me, death may
find its way to you.",
32103,SUPPORT,Uh... Oooh. I see.,
32103,SUPPORT,"I, uh... I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...I'm
willing to take the risk.",
32103,SUPPORT,"I mean, we're in the middle of a war! I could die at
any point now, even tomorrow!",
32103,SUPPORT,"So if being near you means feeling comfortable
during my final hours, well, that sounds like a pretty
good deal to me!",
32103,SUPPORT,...,
32103,SUPPORT,"I...wasn't entirely honest with you just now, about
the whole kindred spirits thingy...",
32103,SUPPORT,"Want the real truth? I actually think we are. You and
I have a whole lot in common.",
32103,SUPPORT,"We both had a dark, troubling past. We both built
walls around ourselves in response to that, to keep
people out.",
32103,SUPPORT,"Me, I take all my past hurts out on myself, but you...
Jeritza, you take yours out on the world.",
32103,SUPPORT,Maybe that's why you harm people.,
32103,SUPPORT,Hmm...,
32103,SUPPORT,"Uh. Uh! Ah! That was really overstepping, wasn't it?
I'm sorry!",
32103,SUPPORT,...,
32104,SUPPORT,"Well, well... Look who it is.",
32104,SUPPORT,"Emile?! It is you, isn't it? Are you feeling more
talkative than when I saw you last?",
32104,SUPPORT,Do not call me that.,
32104,SUPPORT,"Oh, look at you. From professor at the Officers
Academy to an Imperial general...",
32104,SUPPORT,"Though you seem idle enough now. Might you
spare a moment for a proper apology?",
32104,SUPPORT,...,
32104,SUPPORT,"Could you not have even informed me when dear
Mercedes left House Bartels?",
32104,SUPPORT,To say nothing of the scandal you caused...,
32104,SUPPORT,"Granted, I can hardly blame you, that family being
what it was.",
32104,SUPPORT,"But did it never occur to you that I ought to have
been consulted?!",
32104,SUPPORT,"We've only known each other since childhood!
Such callousness! Such rank insensitivity!",
32104,SUPPORT,Emile! Are you listening?!,
32104,SUPPORT,...,
32104,SUPPORT,"You think you can escape? Ahaha! I won't be denied
this time.",
32104,SUPPORT,"You may think yourself skilled with a blade, but
remember that my spellwork is peerless.",
32104,SUPPORT,"Dealing with you would be no more than a
murmured word and a flick of a finger.",
32104,SUPPORT,...,
32104,SUPPORT,"Restrain yourself, Constance.",
32104,SUPPORT,"I am the model of restraint. On the contrary, Emile,
it is you who insists on being so—",
32104,SUPPORT,I said not to call me that.,
32104,SUPPORT,"You know I've not slipped from using General Jeritza
in public. And this is the thanks I get?",
32104,SUPPORT,"Tell me, have you had a proper chat with Mercedes?
You have, surely.",
32104,SUPPORT,"Ugh. You've always been the sort to keep your own
counsel and let others draw their own conclusions.",
32104,SUPPORT,Would it kill you to be silent for once?,
32104,SUPPORT,"Emile, stop! This isn't over!",
32105,SUPPORT,Hey.,
32105,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! Did you send for me, Emile?",
32105,SUPPORT,Stop gossiping about me.,
32105,SUPPORT,"Gossiping? About you? You wound me, Emile. So
what if your name falls from my lips now and then?",
32105,SUPPORT,"If you speak of my past, there will be consequences.",
32105,SUPPORT,"I am aware. I have been silent regarding you secretly
being of House Bartels.",
32105,SUPPORT,"No, when I speak of you, I bandy gentler truths,
such as your fondness for kittens and ice cream.",
32105,SUPPORT,All the silly little details that make you seem human.,
32105,SUPPORT,Those details are nobody's business but mine.,
32105,SUPPORT,"Oh, Emile. Do you have any notion what the rank
and file say about you?",
32105,SUPPORT,No.,
32105,SUPPORT,"They use words like ""unapproachable,"" ""menacing,""
and ""inscrutable.""",
32105,SUPPORT,"Regardless of your skill with a blade, fighting a war
as if it were a long series of duels will end in death.",
32105,SUPPORT,"And that is why I do what I can to ingratiate you
with the soldiers you lead! No thanks necessary.",
32105,SUPPORT,I see you are still...unhappy with me.,
32105,SUPPORT,Ahaha! Whatever do you mean?,
32105,SUPPORT,"The battlefield is solitary, in the end. I've no interest
in camaraderie with soldiers.",
32105,SUPPORT,"Are you implying that, in combat, you are an utterly
matchless warrior?",
32105,SUPPORT,"That you can vanquish any foe singlehandedly?
That you need no cohort supporting you?",
32105,SUPPORT,"How perfectly presumptuous! Even I can admit my
reliance upon others.",
32105,SUPPORT,...,
32105,SUPPORT,"While you fight, who stands beside you to gauge the
tide of battle?",
32105,SUPPORT,"Who eliminates the archers aiming for you? Who
heals whatever injuries you might sustain?",
32105,SUPPORT,"These are questions you should be asking yourself,
Emile. I ask them for you because we are old friends.",
32105,SUPPORT,Always quick to cut to the heart of the matter.,
32105,SUPPORT,Just as you are ever an ache in my side.,
32105,SUPPORT,"Which is nothing compared to the ulcers your sister
must have developed, given your attitude.",
32105,SUPPORT,Whatever.,
32105,SUPPORT,But...there is a truth in your words.,
32105,SUPPORT,"However, it is not up for discussion. Stop gossiping
about me.",
32105,SUPPORT,I shall...consider it.,
32106,SUPPORT,"I must thank you, Emile.",
32106,SUPPORT,Why?,
32106,SUPPORT,You came to my aid in that recent skirmish.,
32106,SUPPORT,"I loathe being in anyone's debt, so I brought you
something as thanks.",
32106,SUPPORT,"How it warms my heart to see you taking my advice
about learning to work with others!",
32106,SUPPORT,I...do not recall...,
32106,SUPPORT,"You don't recall working with others? Or you don't
recall coming to my aid?",
32106,SUPPORT,My memories from battle are always a blur.,
32106,SUPPORT,The creature that you saw...is me and is not me.,
32106,SUPPORT,"Hmm. That sounds perfectly meaningless, and yet
I may know exactly what you mean.",
32106,SUPPORT,"That aside, this should serve to balance the scales
between us. Here.",
32106,SUPPORT,This...,
32106,SUPPORT,"It's the same variety of flower you would give to me,
those many years ago. I found it at a florist in town.",
32106,SUPPORT,"Though I suppose your memory of those days isn't
as sharp as mine.",
32106,SUPPORT,I remember this.,
32106,SUPPORT,"I gave you a rose when Count Nuvelle brought you
along on his visit to House Bartels.",
32106,SUPPORT,"I used to tend to the roses with Mercedes and
Mother in the garden.",
32106,SUPPORT,"So you do remember. The garden of House Bartels
did tend to make an impression.",
32106,SUPPORT,"Mother and Mercedes were always so blissful when
they spent time there.",
32106,SUPPORT,"You picked a rose and gave it to me, like the knights
in the stories.",
32106,SUPPORT,"Your story took a tragic turn... Time has had its way
with you.",
32106,SUPPORT,I thought the same upon seeing you.,
32106,SUPPORT,"Your sympathy is noted. Of the two of us, only I
could be said to have aged gracefully.",
32106,SUPPORT,That is not what I meant.,
32106,SUPPORT,We cannot go back in time. That was my meaning.,
32106,SUPPORT,Do not be so hasty.,
32106,SUPPORT,Anything lost can be regained.,
32106,SUPPORT,"The garden may be gone now, but that will change
once I have rebuilt House Nuvelle!",
32106,SUPPORT,"You'll see when you walk into the grand rose garden
I shall have planted in the center of the estate.",
32106,SUPPORT,"You'll come and see it, won't you, Emile?",
32106,SUPPORT,"Along with Mercedes and your mother, of course.",
32106,SUPPORT,You believe you are capable of that?,
32106,SUPPORT,With you assisting me? It is practically guaranteed.,
32106,SUPPORT,Is it now...,
32106,SUPPORT,"Some will undoubtedly take forceful issue with the
restoration. That's where you come in.",
32106,SUPPORT,"What a privilege I am granting you, to play a part in
the return of my noble house! Ahaha!",
32106,SUPPORT,Hm-hm...,
32106,SUPPORT,"A smile? Spreading across your face? Now that is
a rare blossom indeed.",
32106,SUPPORT,Only when in the company of a select few.,
32107,SUPPORT,Hmm... The Myrmidon.,
32107,SUPPORT,"Heh, suit yourself! My gut says the odds are in favor
of that mercenary. He's clearly a seasoned f—",
32107,SUPPORT,"Gah! Right when I open my big mouth, he goes and
loses on me.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Hahaha, I win! Again. Had enough, Balthus?",
32107,SUPPORT,"Damn you! You've won every round! The fights are
rigged, admit it. It's the only explanation.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Heh, of course they aren't. It's not like we're playing
for money. We wouldn't be so foolish now,
would we?",
32107,SUPPORT,"You're the one who started this silly game, anyway.
So out with it. You lost—spill the beans.",
32107,SUPPORT,"It has to be juicy, though. Something that leaves you
a bit...vulnerable.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Why did I agree to these stakes? If this losing streak
keeps up, you'll know an awful lot about me, pal.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Let's see... OK, got one! A few years back, I went
toe-to-toe with a bird beast in some ancient ruins.",
32107,SUPPORT,"This one again? You obliterated the ruins, and a lord
who found out put a price on your head. You've told
me a thousand times before.",
32107,SUPPORT,"A good story bears repeating, yeah? But it seems I'm
all out of anecdotes. How about I take my shirt off
and let you look your fill instead. Two full minutes.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Oh, come now. As if I'm interested in seeing your
sweaty torso for the umpteenth time.",
32107,SUPPORT,"If you're fresh out of stories, then I have a question
for you. About your Crest.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Hit me where it hurts, why don'tcha? Is this your
idea of negotiation?",
32107,SUPPORT,"Perhaps... Or perhaps I'm simply curious. Tell me,
how did you come across such a rarity?",
32107,SUPPORT,"To my knowledge, nobody within House Albrecht
has your Crest.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Why ask what you already know? You've got your
own rare Crest, so I'm sure you've figured it out.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Unless you think the goddess gave us these things
while we slept, hehe. Wait...do you?",
32107,SUPPORT,"Hey now. I'm the one winning the bets, so I'm the
one asking the questions.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Got me there. Hey, look! The next round's starting.
My luck's about to turn around, I can feel it.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Let's do you a favor and call it good here. No need
to embarrass yourself further, friend.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Even if I'm terrible at this, I can't walk away during a
losing streak. I have my own sort of honor.",
32107,SUPPORT,...,
32107,SUPPORT,"All right, Balthus. Check out...those two Myrmidons.",
32107,SUPPORT,"The two who were eating together earlier? Huh.
Who knew they were opponents.",
32107,SUPPORT,I kind of figured. Thoughts?,
32107,SUPPORT,"Well, that one's pretty beefy. Quick on his feet too.
Clearly a seasoned fighter.",
32107,SUPPORT,"His opponent's OK, but a bit showy. Compensating
for being newer at this, would be my guess.",
32107,SUPPORT,Mm-hmm. So? Make your choice.,
32107,SUPPORT,"Thank you. First guy, no doubt about it. You can see
from a mile away...that...",
32107,SUPPORT,HE LOST?! Wow. That was quick.,
32107,SUPPORT,"Not everything is as it appears. For example, were
you and I to go at it, perhaps you'd bet in favor of
yourself over me.",
32107,SUPPORT,"And you'd lose. I'd use my cunning to ensure my
victory. By any means necessary.",
32107,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'd slip something into your food—level the
playing field. You see now?",
32107,SUPPORT,"Point taken. I'll keep that in mind for this next one.
Gotta put that great advice to the test, right?",
32107,SUPPORT,"Heheheh, ever the bold one. It seems we must
continue these games until you finally concede.",
32108,SUPPORT,"Argh! This is pointless! My head's about to split
in two...",
32108,SUPPORT,"Wow. Balthus? What's with you, friend?",
32108,SUPPORT,"Never seen you so deep in thought. Next thing I
know, snow will be dumping out of the sky here
in Abyss, hahaha!",
32108,SUPPORT,"Shut your trap! I'm driving myself crazy over here.
Got a lot on my mind, OK?",
32108,SUPPORT,Like?,
32108,SUPPORT,"Gah, fine. You know how I never got any stories out
of you the other day?",
32108,SUPPORT,How could I forget? I won every last round.,
32108,SUPPORT,"It was clear that both Lady Luck and the goddess
herself had given up on you. Your powers of
deliberation weren't any help either.",
32108,SUPPORT,"You caught me off my stride, got it? But it was clear
I'd never win a story from you, so I went digging.",
32108,SUPPORT,Uh-huh.,
32108,SUPPORT,"I was especially curious about that Crest of yours, so
I went rifling around for a lead and got to thinkin'.",
32108,SUPPORT,"You must have time on your hands if you're spending
it thinking. Well? Let's hear it.",
32108,SUPPORT,"There's a story they tell where my mom grew up.
Long ago, the village got in a squabble with some
folks looking to conquer the place.",
32108,SUPPORT,"A village elder gave some holy red stuff to their
wounded soldiers. Some kind of liquid, who knows...",
32108,SUPPORT,"After she did that, some of them made a complete
recovery, against all odds.",
32108,SUPPORT,"The rest of them were changed, but not for the
better. They up and vanished before long.",
32108,SUPPORT,And then?,
32108,SUPPORT,"Crests suddenly manifested for the ones
who survived.",
32108,SUPPORT,"They weren't inherited, or gifted by the goddess.
It's a real thinker, yeah? A reaaal thinker...",
32108,SUPPORT,"Near death but survived, despite all odds. Wait!
The elder who my mom saved... Could he have
used something similar?",
32108,SUPPORT,"No, it can't be. Yet...something here is unsettling in
its familiarity.",
32108,SUPPORT,"Hit the mark, did I?",
32108,SUPPORT,"I don't know whether you hit the mark or missed it
entirely. But your story was a cute one, regardless.",
32108,SUPPORT,"The truth is, I've been trying to sort out who I am.
And, well... I haven't been successful in it.",
32108,SUPPORT,"I don't even know whether my mother is truly my
birth mother...or why it is I have this Crest.",
32108,SUPPORT,"At this point, I have nothing but speculations.
Maybe I'll sink into my grave without ever knowing
the truth.",
32108,SUPPORT,"Lots of things in life don't have an answer. Just pick
the story you like best and run with it.",
32108,SUPPORT,"That's better than finding out a truth you can't live
with. You can really mess your head up like that.",
32108,SUPPORT,...,
32108,SUPPORT,"Dammit, you're right. To think that something so
trivial could bother someone like me.",
32108,SUPPORT,"Look who's a quick learner! Thinking too much'll
sap your energy, pal. I avoid it whenever possible.",
32108,SUPPORT,"In fact, it's been ages since I last thought so deeply.
My head is really hurting now, heh.",
32108,SUPPORT,"But if that old legend is true...what was that holy red
stuff? What happened to the vanished soldiers?!",
32108,SUPPORT,"Once I start thinking about all that, I keep going
round and round in my head... And then it's dawn...
and then it's nightfall and then it's dawn again, and...",
32108,SUPPORT,Ah— Hey! Balthus?!,
32108,SUPPORT,"Let me at 'em! Oh? Ah. Not a fight, then. Heh, that's
what I get for overusing the old noggin.",
32108,SUPPORT,You damn fool!,
32109,SUPPORT,Hey. Take this.,
32109,SUPPORT,"Hm? That smell...that sound... This is gold!
A sizable stash of precious gold!",
32109,SUPPORT,"What gives? Don't tell me you got your mitts on the
church's vault...",
32109,SUPPORT,"What gives? Don't tell me you got your mitts on the
Empire's vault...",
32109,SUPPORT,"You fool. It's simply a reward. Nothing to get in a
tizzy over.",
32109,SUPPORT,"No way I can accept this, pal. Trust me, I haven't
done anything to deserve it.",
32109,SUPPORT,"Just shut up and take it. Call it your fee for providing
me with information.",
32109,SUPPORT,"What you told me—the tale from your mother's
homeland—it really helped me.",
32109,SUPPORT,"Anyway, if you don't actually need it, I'm sure you'll
find a use for it. Maybe take your mom out for a
night on the town?",
32109,SUPPORT,"Looks like you're insisting, then. Fine! I'll use it to
buy her some good grub.",
32109,SUPPORT,"But I thought you didn't actually find any answers in
my little tale.",
32109,SUPPORT,Not quite. But it helped me in other ways.,
32109,SUPPORT,"I've stopped vexing myself over unimportant details,
like who I am or who I think I might be.",
32109,SUPPORT,"That's all fine and good, but is it really worth its
weight in gold? This is coin we're talking about!",
32109,SUPPORT,"Look, do you want it or not? Is there something else
you'd prefer?",
32109,SUPPORT,Haa...,
32109,SUPPORT,Wow. That was one hell of a sigh.,
32109,SUPPORT,"Look, you're better than me at thinking. And betting.
But right this moment, you're the fool. You.",
32109,SUPPORT,"Do I like gold? Yes. Do I want it? Need it? Yes and
yes. While we're at it, I like brawling. Women too.",
32109,SUPPORT,"But there's something that I care about even more
than gold, fighting, and women. Any ideas?",
32109,SUPPORT,"Oh, this is tough. Um, let me guess... Hopelessly
losing every bet you place? A good drink?",
32109,SUPPORT,"You really think highly of me, don't you? Dead
wrong! It's having a bash bro, a friend to fight
with and fight for.",
32109,SUPPORT,Seems I was a bit off base there.,
32109,SUPPORT,"I guess to you, everyone is either an underling or a
business associate.",
32109,SUPPORT,"But with a bash bro, there's no such thing as an
""overdue loan."" No hierarchies or other nonsense.",
32109,SUPPORT,"It's someone to trust, both in and out of battle.
Someone to share life's ups and downs with.",
32109,SUPPORT,"I...see. No need to reward a bash bro, I suppose.",
32109,SUPPORT,"That's the ticket. I know you were born into a world
of trickery and exploitation, but you don't have to
live like that anymore. Now you've got me.",
32109,SUPPORT,"I'm not accustomed to talks like this, I must admit.
Hm... How can I frame this...",
32109,SUPPORT,"Nobody even knows my real name. Are you actually
comfortable confessing such a warmth toward
someone so...cold?",
32109,SUPPORT,"Clearly. No matter who you are or what you've done,
I care about you. That won't ever change.",
32109,SUPPORT,"Haha, now that is fresh.",
32109,SUPPORT,"I told you my feelings and you laughed... Heh!
You're one-of-a-kind, pal.",
32109,SUPPORT,"I'm sorry. I've got to admit I thought I'd heard it all,
but you've managed to surprise me.",
32109,SUPPORT,"It's the first time anyone has ever said something so
sincere, without trying to get something out of me.",
32109,SUPPORT,"I could try to say it again with more swagger,
if that helps.",
32109,SUPPORT,"Nah, no need. Bash bros. Has a nice ring to it.",
32109,SUPPORT,"From here forward, we are forever bash bros, friend!",
32109,SUPPORT,"I've got your back, pal.",
32110,SUPPORT,"Yuri! Halt! How dare you make me run all over
the monastery!",
32110,SUPPORT,"Calm down. That was all on you, Shady Lady.",
32110,SUPPORT,"""Shady""?! You know full well I'm sensitive about
that! It's as though you wish to be incinerated!",
32110,SUPPORT,"Ahem. What I mean to say is all shall be forgiven
when you do my bidding.",
32110,SUPPORT,Uh...,
32110,SUPPORT,"I know, I know. It's an honor I don't extend to many.
You have the rare opportunity to aid me in realizing
my dream.",
32110,SUPPORT,"I shall rebuild House Nuvelle! Nobility will be mine
again, and the glory of my esteemed family will once
more reign supreme!",
32110,SUPPORT,"Blah, blah, blah, restore House Nuvelle, blah,
blah, blah. Will you just stop? You're making
my ears hurt.",
32110,SUPPORT,"I am but an insignificant and beautiful creature.
Surely there's nothing I have to offer for your plight.",
32110,SUPPORT,"Your facade does not fool me. I know you for what
you truly are.",
32110,SUPPORT,"With the nobility's backing, western Fódlan's 
underworld is yours. Everyone has heard whispers
of the Savage Mockingbird.",
32110,SUPPORT,"That is you they refer to, yes? Hm-hm-hm!",
32110,SUPPORT,...,
32110,SUPPORT,"Your time would be better spent laying the
groundwork for me to reclaim my title.",
32110,SUPPORT,"I envision you using your connections to apply
pressure on the nobles in Enbarr.",
32110,SUPPORT,"Right. So say I indulge you—that I agree I'm this...
killer bird you speak of.",
32110,SUPPORT,"What I offer comes at a high price. You do
understand that, right, milady?",
32110,SUPPORT,How exactly do you intend to compensate me?,
32110,SUPPORT,"But what greater compensation could I offer than to
play a part in restoring House Nuvelle?",
32110,SUPPORT,"Restoration of houses does nothing to put food in
my stomach.",
32110,SUPPORT,"I suppose... But rest assured that upon my return to
power, you shall be suitably rewarded.",
32110,SUPPORT,"Let me cut through the mud here—you're broke,
and you'll pay me after you get what you want.
Wow. I love how irresponsible you are! Refreshing!",
32110,SUPPORT,"Then what would you have me do?! I have nothing
to bargain with now! No status! No wealth!",
32110,SUPPORT,"Perhaps rather than turning to a killer bird for
help, you should be bowing before the nobles or
some such.",
32110,SUPPORT,"Get down on all fours and lick their boots, see what
that'll get you. Haha, perhaps you're too prim and
proper for that?",
32110,SUPPORT,"""Lick their boots""? Is tonguing their footwear likely
to sway them to my cause?",
32110,SUPPORT,My work here is done.,
32110,SUPPORT,"No! I was not through with you yet! Y-you come
back here! Hey!",
32111,SUPPORT,"Hey, Shady Lady. I see you're working into the
wee hours.",
32111,SUPPORT,I have asked you before not to refer to me that way.,
32111,SUPPORT,"Right, right, whatever. Sorry. Uh, anyway, what
kind of bizarre spells are you weaving?",
32111,SUPPORT,Ahaha! An excellent question.,
32111,SUPPORT,"It's a brand of spellcraft many have dreamed of but
none have achieved. A revolution in magical theory.",
32111,SUPPORT,"Revolutionary spellwork, huh?",
32111,SUPPORT,Steel yourself for this!,
32111,SUPPORT,"The working transforms leather boots into licorice!
The old, serviceable shape with a new, sweeter taste.",
32111,SUPPORT,"Uh...huh. That's certainly...something. I'm sure
you'll ravage the economy with this one.",
32111,SUPPORT,"So, um... Why boots, precisely?",
32111,SUPPORT,"I was inspired by your suggestion that licking the
nobility's boots would fulfill my dream.",
32111,SUPPORT,"I went to my chambers to discreetly taste my own
boots. They were less appetizing than I had hoped.",
32111,SUPPORT,"The thought of licking boots day in and day out
was revolting...but then I thought, ""what if?""",
32111,SUPPORT,"Tonguing licorice boots rather than leather ones
would make the whole ordeal much more palatable!",
32111,SUPPORT,...,
32111,SUPPORT,"This is no run-of-the-mill, penny-ante black magic.
This is something new—black licorice magic!",
32111,SUPPORT,"I could lick the boots of a hundred nobles if they all
tasted so scrumptious as licorice!",
32111,SUPPORT,Are you some kind of damn fool?,
32111,SUPPORT,"Ahaha. The common mind often has difficulty
distinguishing between genius and idiocy.",
32111,SUPPORT,"You set me the challenge of licking boots, and I
would say that I have risen to it ably.",
32111,SUPPORT,"Correct. I told you to do that. But I think you took
what I said just a bit too literally.",
32111,SUPPORT,"Then how did you mean it? Does the licking not
count if the licker enjoys it?",
32111,SUPPORT,"It's mostly something you do by way of acting
subservient. ""I'd even lick the mud from your
boots, my lord!"" Get it?",
32111,SUPPORT,"What?! Are there nobles so depraved that they would
take satisfaction in such a thing?!",
32111,SUPPORT,There sure are. I've licked a boot or three in my day.,
32111,SUPPORT,Indeed? Ugh! Did it not turn your stomach?,
32111,SUPPORT,"Well, of course it did. There's hardly any dignity
in bootlicking.",
32111,SUPPORT,"Talking to you is truly...entertaining. You are a
special kind of strange. I've known many a noble
in my life, but none like you.",
32111,SUPPORT,"I was just dealing with a bunch of them, so the
difference seems especially stark.",
32111,SUPPORT,"Though, I guess you're not technically a noble at this
point, are you?",
32111,SUPPORT,"You were dealing with nobles in the dead of night?
Wait— What?! D-did you just call me strange?!",
32111,SUPPORT,"Oof, I'm exhausted. Better go hit the sack. Don't
work too hard, milady!",
32111,SUPPORT,"I did not give you leave to go! Ugh. His rudeness
knows no bounds.",
32111,SUPPORT,"But I'll have my revenge. Perhaps by exposing his
business with these nobles...",
32111,SUPPORT,"He'll rue the day he loosened his tongue in front
of me! Ahahaha!",
32112,SUPPORT,"Remember when you mentioned briefly that you'd
been in conference with some nobles?",
32112,SUPPORT,Did the topic of conversation happen to be...me?,
32112,SUPPORT,I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about.,
32112,SUPPORT,"Don't be coy with me. I recently received an offer
of support from the Minister of Foreign Affairs.",
32112,SUPPORT,"Don't be coy with me. I recently received an offer of
support from Count Charon.",
32112,SUPPORT,"Bravo. Your dream of restoring your house is that
much closer now, isn't it?",
32112,SUPPORT,"We shall see. My response is on hold until I could
confirm something first.",
32112,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32112,SUPPORT,"You sound as befuddled as I feel! These are events
you set in motion, are they not?",
32112,SUPPORT,"I want only the truth from you! Lie to me, and you
shall be incinerated!",
32112,SUPPORT,"That doesn't leave me much wiggle room, does it?",
32112,SUPPORT,"All right, I'll tell you. So yeah, I might have been
negotiating with some nobles. Maybe. Possibly.",
32112,SUPPORT,"You do recall that I have nothing I can offer you in
return, yes?",
32112,SUPPORT,"Pfft, of course I know that. I just did what I needed
to get what I wanted. Like always.",
32112,SUPPORT,Explain.,
32112,SUPPORT,"All my life, I've known how to angle to get
everything I've ever wanted. Money, social
standing, the whole kit and caboodle.",
32112,SUPPORT,"See, that's how the Savage Mockingbird lives. Ever
since I was a kid, it's how I've done things.",
32112,SUPPORT,"What does that have to do with— Wait! Are you
admitting to being the Savage Mockingbird?!",
32112,SUPPORT,"And I find myself wanting in on this house of yours.
The one you've yet to rebuild.",
32112,SUPPORT,"What?! No. No, wait. You haven't yet answered my
question about the Savage—",
32112,SUPPORT,"Preened as this bird might be, his only home is a
dark, wet back alley. As long as I'm me, nothing
can change that.",
32112,SUPPORT,"So I figured, if I could leave that ""home"" of mine and
live simply as Yuri, even if only for a while...",
32112,SUPPORT,"You know, I might like somewhere proper to return
to. Somewhere cozy. Comfy, even. Better than
House Rowe, where last I leapt from.",
32112,SUPPORT,I'm not sure what you're insinuating here.,
32112,SUPPORT,"I'll get your house back for you, and I only ask for
one thing as payment...",
32112,SUPPORT,"Once House Nuvelle is back in good standing,
I want a home there.",
32112,SUPPORT,"You mean...you wish to join House Nuvelle? But the
only way to do that—",
32112,SUPPORT,"Marriage. Bingo. Quick, easy, simple.",
32112,SUPPORT,You and I? Spouses?!,
32112,SUPPORT,"You heard me. It's a fine enough trade.
What's the problem?",
32112,SUPPORT,"I mentioned nothing about a problem. Where did
you get that notion?",
32112,SUPPORT,"I've always found you very useful. Though I could
do with less—much less—of your backtalk.",
32112,SUPPORT,"I suppose ""milady"" doesn't want a rogue for a
husband. Hahaha, can't handle all that is Yuri, hm?",
32112,SUPPORT,"No, no. But there is a procedure to this sort of thing.
How can you join my house when I have none?",
32112,SUPPORT,"What? You want to do things in order? How boring.
I suppose we'll be lovers for now.",
32112,SUPPORT,"Ugh! You mock me! You mock me—and I will not
have it!",
32112,SUPPORT,"Me? Mock? I'm being sincere. I'd never live out
another dull day with you by my side.",
32112,SUPPORT,"That is my only fear—a life spent by your side may
be more taxing than I could stand!",
32112,SUPPORT,"Seeing you so flustered provides endless
entertainment, heh heh...",
32113,SUPPORT,...,
32113,SUPPORT,...,
32113,SUPPORT,This is boring. Mind if I sleep?,
32113,SUPPORT,"You know I won't care. Night watch or not, it's still
just for training purposes.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Though, you'd likely get in trouble if someone sees
you catching z's.",
32113,SUPPORT,"You wouldn't wake me if someone was here?
Fine then, I won't sleep.",
32113,SUPPORT,Your call.,
32113,SUPPORT,...,
32113,SUPPORT,...,
32113,SUPPORT,"You're being so quiet, Yuri-bird. Say something.",
32113,SUPPORT,"I don't always fill the void with my voice, you
know. Sometimes it's pleasant to just enjoy the
quiet and stargaze.",
32113,SUPPORT,"No, thanks. Stargazing is a waste of time. The stars
don't even stay put all year, those jerks.",
32113,SUPPORT,"See that one? That star is home to the goddess...
Yeah! Watching over us from afar.",
32113,SUPPORT,...,
32113,SUPPORT,"That's called the Blue Sea Star, but it doesn't look
blue...at all, really.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Wait, no. Hang on. Maybe it wasn't that one. But
that big one over there—that's it...isn't it?",
32113,SUPPORT,"You don't know the first thing about stars, do you?
No one ever taught you?",
32113,SUPPORT,"Never, no.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Well, the Blue Sea Star is really big. It stands out.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Sometimes you can't see it at all, but other times it's
the brightest thing in the sky.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Interesting! So then, which star was I pointing out
just now?",
32113,SUPPORT,"You might have to point it out again. Which
constellation were you looking at?",
32113,SUPPORT,"Let's see... It looks a bit like a cat... No, no, that's not
right. Maybe more like a fish? Or a...fishing rod!",
32113,SUPPORT,Hm-hm!,
32113,SUPPORT,"What? I'm serious! See, those stars there are forming
a shape that looks very much like a fishing rod.",
32113,SUPPORT,"OK, sorry, but that looks nothing like a fishing rod.
Or a cat.",
32113,SUPPORT,"I'm surprised you know so little about stars.
I thought you knew everything.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Who do you think I am—the goddess herself? There
is plenty I don't know.",
32113,SUPPORT,"But I'm always aiming to learn more.
I'm uncomfortable not...knowing things.",
32113,SUPPORT,"So come on then, Hapi. Teach me about the stars.",
32113,SUPPORT,That'll be a pain for both of us.,
32113,SUPPORT,"As painful as sitting here idling? It's not like you're
going to sleep at this point.",
32113,SUPPORT,Clearly you know quite a bit about them—teach me.,
32113,SUPPORT,"Fine, fine. Look up there, to the north.",
32113,SUPPORT,"Your other north. See that star? That's called the
King's Right Hand...",
32114,SUPPORT,"Let me get this straight. The stars aren't moving, but
the ground we stand on...is?",
32114,SUPPORT,"Yup. We're on a big round thing that's always
spinning, and that's why the stars seem to move
through the sky.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Hard to believe, isn't it? But it's true.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I admit I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head
around it. How is it you know these things, anyway?",
32114,SUPPORT,"If you were a noble, it would make sense that you'd
have a formal education on all of this.",
32114,SUPPORT,"In the village where I was born, there were people
who studied the stars. They taught me.",
32114,SUPPORT,"A village of stargazing folk, huh? Do tell. I've never
heard of such a place.",
32114,SUPPORT,It's a...very well-hidden village.,
32114,SUPPORT,"It was a small settlement deep in the forest where
no one ever bothered us.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I was born there, grew up there... But when I got
older, I felt like I needed to see the world.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I couldn't live my whole life in one place, y'know?
So I struck out on my own.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I always knew you were an odd little bird, but your
birthplace makes you a rare little bird.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Yeah, well, pretty soon after leaving her nest, this
rare little bird was put in a cage.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I thought it might be some kind of punishment for
leaving the forest.",
32114,SUPPORT,"What the hell? You think that because you wanted to
live your life, you'd be punished? That's ridiculous.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Look at this objectively—was it punishment, or was
it just plain bad luck?",
32114,SUPPORT,"There's nothing wrong with wanting to see the world
and expand your horizons.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Take me... Had I never left that gutter I call home,
I'd have gone my whole life never learning how to
look at the stars.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Yeah... I left my village because I thought I'd find a
better life beyond the forest. Now I'm not so sure.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Regret is pointless. What matters is how we live right
here, right now. You know?",
32114,SUPPORT,Yeah...,
32114,SUPPORT,Do you ever want to return back home?,
32114,SUPPORT,"I could say no, but I'd be lying. I've been feeling
homesick lately.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Nothing happened there, for better or worse.
There wasn't much to be scared of.",
32114,SUPPORT,"Everyone said the outside world was dangerous,
that beyond the forest, all we'd find was an
early grave.",
32114,SUPPORT,"That wasn't exactly true, but my life was for sure
easier when I lived there.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I used to spend my days fishing, hunting for pretty
flowers, running around for no reason...",
32114,SUPPORT,A rare occurrence indeed.,
32114,SUPPORT,What is?,
32114,SUPPORT,"Seeing you smile in that way. You're always so...
I don't know...neutral?",
32114,SUPPORT,"That's not true. I smile when there's something to
smile about.",
32114,SUPPORT,"It's strange, though. When I'm talking to you, I can't
help but let my guard down.",
32114,SUPPORT,"I don't like to discuss where I came from. But with
you, I feel like I can open up.",
32114,SUPPORT,"You know, I've been thinking a lot about my mom
and dad lately. I wonder...are they even alive?",
32114,SUPPORT,...,
32115,SUPPORT,"So, Hapi. Are you going back home or what?",
32115,SUPPORT,"That came out of nowhere. Haven't you noticed
there's a war going on? I can't leave now.",
32115,SUPPORT,"Hm, hadn't noticed, nope. Now that I have, will you
head home once it's over? To check on your parents.",
32115,SUPPORT,"No. Even after the war, I can't return.",
32115,SUPPORT,"With my curse, I might destroy the whole village.
I won't put them at risk like that.",
32115,SUPPORT,"True. I want to say you could go there and
everything would be dandy.",
32115,SUPPORT,"The way things tend to shake out, though, it can be
pretty hard not to sigh...",
32115,SUPPORT,"What about you? You don't mind spending all this
time away from...wherever you call home?",
32115,SUPPORT,"Can't say I've spent much time thinking about it.
Maybe after the war is over.",
32115,SUPPORT,"I've got plenty to keep me occupied. If I drop things
and head home, my people will lose respect for me.
I can't have that.",
32115,SUPPORT,I see.,
32115,SUPPORT,I know I should visit home at some point.,
32115,SUPPORT,"It's been more than a decade since I left, though.
They probably think I died.",
32115,SUPPORT,They might. All the more reason for you to go back.,
32115,SUPPORT,"I know you're scared. But if you keep your visit brief,
it'll work out fine.",
32115,SUPPORT,"I don't know about yours, but my mother would
want to know that I'm OK.",
32115,SUPPORT,"I suppose I could stop by for a short visit.
That might be nice...",
32115,SUPPORT,"Still worried? I can accompany you. I'm sure you'll
find some use for me.",
32115,SUPPORT,Huh?,
32115,SUPPORT,"You know you'll be so caught up in my lively
conversations, you'll have very little time for sighing.",
32115,SUPPORT,...,
32115,SUPPORT,"Hmm... That plan could backfire. I might find the
conversation boring, and then...",
32115,SUPPORT,"That would never happen. I wouldn't allow for it.
And on the off chance a beast does appear...",
32115,SUPPORT,"Well, that'll clear up your boredom pretty quickly,
won't it?",
32115,SUPPORT,"You've got a weird sense of humor, Yuri-bird.
I like that.",
32115,SUPPORT,"I guess I wouldn't feel so nervous about going home
if you went with me. I might even have a good time.",
32115,SUPPORT,"When you're there, you feel closer to the stars.
They look so clear and bright.",
32115,SUPPORT,I'd love to show you.,
32115,SUPPORT,"Ahaha. I look forward to it. I bet we'll even see some
of the stars you taught me about.",
32115,SUPPORT,"And maybe I'll finally lay eyes on that constellation
you told me about. A fishing rod, was it?",
32116,SUPPORT,"♪Hm hmm hm-hmm... Hm hmm hm-hmm...♪
Huh?! Is that Yuri?",
32116,SUPPORT,"I gotta evaporate! Maybe if I just curl into a ball, I'll
pass as a boulder. Or a...pebble.",
32116,SUPPORT,"Hey, Bernadetta!",
32116,SUPPORT,Ah! You can see me?!,
32116,SUPPORT,"Clearly... You're a tricky one. Always trying to hide
when I'm around.",
32116,SUPPORT,S-sorry! Please forgive me!,
32116,SUPPORT,"If you want forgiveness, then explain yourself. But
make it quick. You always ramble on.",
32116,SUPPORT,"Um! Well, when I was little, my mother and father,
they—",
32116,SUPPORT,"You've gotta be kidding. Cut to the chase, please.",
32116,SUPPORT,Uh... You remind me of one of my old friends.,
32116,SUPPORT,"Oh, come now. Whoever this friend of yours is can't
possibly compare to me.",
32116,SUPPORT,I'm telling the truth!,
32116,SUPPORT,"All right, all right. What was this friend like, then?",
32116,SUPPORT,"The way you run and hide from me, they must've
been a real piece of work.",
32116,SUPPORT,That's not it at all!,
32116,SUPPORT,"He was the assistant to the gardener at our estate.
My friend was gentle, trustworthy...gorgeous.",
32116,SUPPORT,"And...well, he was the only person who was ever
nice to me.",
32116,SUPPORT,We used to run around the gardens playing together.,
32116,SUPPORT,And why is it you keep running away from me?,
32116,SUPPORT,"That's... Uh... Do I really have to say? We hardly
even know each other!",
32116,SUPPORT,"You never have to do anything. But if you don't, you
and I won't have a shot at knowing one another,
and you'll carry on avoiding me forever.",
32116,SUPPORT,But that's no good either! OK! OK! I'll tell you!,
32116,SUPPORT,"The thing is, because of me, he got in trouble. After
that, I never saw him again.",
32116,SUPPORT,"You see, my father hated commoners, and when
he found out I was spending a lot of time with
one... Well...",
32116,SUPPORT,"He's probably dead now! And it's all my fault! It's
'cause of me! He must have hated me!",
32116,SUPPORT,"That... Ugh. That doesn't sound right to me.
Why would you think all that?",
32116,SUPPORT,"Nothing you did would make his death your fault.
And hating you for something that isn't your fault
is absolutely absurd—delusional, even.",
32116,SUPPORT,"You're wrong! He'd definitely hate me if he knew!
How would you know, anyway?",
32116,SUPPORT,"What, did you know my friend or something?",
32116,SUPPORT,In a manner... Right.,
32116,SUPPORT,"So, remember back when you were a kid?",
32116,SUPPORT,"You tripped while holding some gardening shears.
And your friend got cut pretty badly.",
32116,SUPPORT,"Hmmm... Oh yeah! I remember. But...how did you
know about that?",
32116,SUPPORT,"If I bore you any ill will, it would have only been for
cutting my face with those damn shears.",
32116,SUPPORT,Cutting your face... Shears... But! There's no way!,
32116,SUPPORT,"But there is. That friend? That was me, Bernadetta.",
32116,SUPPORT,"Anyway, I'm glad I finally got to hear how you felt
about all of that.",
32116,SUPPORT,"Let's spend time together later and chat about the
good ol' days. Get to know each other again.",
32116,SUPPORT,But how did... But he! But!,
32117,SUPPORT,...,
32117,SUPPORT,"Bernadetta, knock it off. How long are you gonna
keep this up?",
32117,SUPPORT,"I can't have him find me. Time for a
tactical withdrawal!",
32117,SUPPORT,"Wait up, would you? Running away every time you
see me is just going to wear us both out.",
32117,SUPPORT,"If you've got something to say, say it already. You've
been shadowing me for ages. Think how I feel.",
32117,SUPPORT,"I mean, when we have missions together, you avoid
me like the plague. Even the professor doesn't know
what to say.",
32117,SUPPORT,"You don't show up for war council when I'm there.
Do you even know what's going on in the world?",
32117,SUPPORT,"I know, but I... I... I just can't, OK?!",
32117,SUPPORT,"I can't be around you, Yuri. It's just not doable!",
32117,SUPPORT,"I know what my father did to you. It's all just too
overwhelming! I thought you died...",
32117,SUPPORT,"You thought I had. But I hadn't. I was halfway to my
grave, but I survived.",
32117,SUPPORT,"Half...way?! Then that means the half of you that
survived is gonna seek revenge on me!",
32117,SUPPORT,"I was half dead, sure, but that really meant I was able
to get out with my life.",
32117,SUPPORT,"If I was to seek revenge, it would be on the count—
not you.",
32117,SUPPORT,"When I'm looking to make things even, it's all or
nothing.",
32117,SUPPORT,"You wouldn't be standing here talking to me right
now if I'd targeted you.",
32117,SUPPORT,"If not here, then where would I be?! At the bottom
of a ravine?!",
32117,SUPPORT,I wouldn't push you off a cliffside.,
32117,SUPPORT,"Maybe you'll tie me to a big rock and drop me in the
ocean! Is that it?!",
32117,SUPPORT,You're gonna turn me into fish food! I knew it!,
32117,SUPPORT,What are you going on about?,
32117,SUPPORT,"Mercy! If it has to be a watery grave, please just drop
me in icy waters so I freeze instead of drown!",
32117,SUPPORT,Kid's got issues...,
32117,SUPPORT,"Well, I guess I'd better tell her everything.",
32118,SUPPORT,Frigid ocean waters! I can feel them already!,
32118,SUPPORT,"Calm, caaaalm. Just listen to me for a moment.
There's something I need to tell you.",
32118,SUPPORT,"The reason I worked for House Varley, Bernadetta,
was to kill you.",
32118,SUPPORT,"Aha! I knew it! I always knew you were out to kill
me! Sink me into the deep, dark, freezing depths...",
32118,SUPPORT,Hold on. House Varley? But...why?,
32118,SUPPORT,"As you well know, theirs is one of the six great noble
houses—the true rulers of the Empire.",
32118,SUPPORT,"And you're the heir...with a Crest. There were tons
of people who wanted you wiped out.",
32118,SUPPORT,"Like people who want to eradicate House Varley.
Or a relative who wants the glory for themselves.",
32118,SUPPORT,"That particular breed of treacherous nobility...is the
kind that'd hire a kid to do their dirty work.",
32118,SUPPORT,"The first thing that kid would do? Get close to the
target by befriending her, find an in through, say,
an assistant gig.",
32118,SUPPORT,"This kid you're mentioning sounds...real. That was
you, wasn't it...",
32118,SUPPORT,"Yours truly. My biggest mistake? Getting to
know you.",
32118,SUPPORT,"I crept into your room one night and readied my
blade.",
32118,SUPPORT,"The whole thing had been a breeze, up until that
moment. I couldn't bring myself to do it.",
32118,SUPPORT,"While I hovered there, hesitating, your father came
in. You know the rest.",
32118,SUPPORT,Why are you telling me all this? I'm so confused...,
32118,SUPPORT,"Because I want you to look at it objectively. I was
hired to kill you. Your father protected you from me,
a filthy assassin.",
32118,SUPPORT,"He was looking out for you. You're lucky to have a
father who cares for you enough to do that.",
32118,SUPPORT,Father...protected me? He...protected me...,
32118,SUPPORT,"Yeah, why would I lie?",
32118,SUPPORT,"At this point, I figure it's you who hates me, and not
the other way around.",
32118,SUPPORT,"I don't hate you, Yuri! But I mean, I do feel weird...
But I don't know how to feel... I just...",
32118,SUPPORT,Can't we just be friends? Like back then?,
32118,SUPPORT,You want to be friends? With...me?,
32118,SUPPORT,"The reason you couldn't kill me was because we
were friends. Right?",
32118,SUPPORT,Well...,
32118,SUPPORT,You were my first friend.,
32118,SUPPORT,"My very first friend. The first person who played
with me. The first person who went on adventures
with me. The first—",
32118,SUPPORT,"And you were the first friend I had to baby
that much.",
32118,SUPPORT,"What do you mean?! Well...even so... You were the
first friend who cared for me!",
32118,SUPPORT,The whole thing was probably a sham anyway.,
32118,SUPPORT,"Though, you know... Even if it was...I did have a lot
of fun with you.",
32118,SUPPORT,Heh! I knew it!,
32119,SUPPORT,"It's time I fessed up, Yurikins. I saw the whole thing.",
32119,SUPPORT,What was it you think you saw?,
32119,SUPPORT,"It looked like you were singing to the children in the
alley out back.",
32119,SUPPORT,"And may I say, you were fantastic. Your performance
hit me right in the heart.",
32119,SUPPORT,"That was a song from Mittelfrank's Imperial capital
show, right?",
32119,SUPPORT,"Ah, the good old days. You must have come back
night after night if you remember it that well.",
32119,SUPPORT,"Perhaps a few times... I remember well how you
looked upon that stage.",
32119,SUPPORT,"You were the talk of the capital among all the nobles.
Unsurpassable? Yes, that was it.",
32119,SUPPORT,"It's hard to believe I'd run into that unsurpassable
songstress in a place like this. Hm. Luck is on my
side, as ever.",
32119,SUPPORT,"I couldn't convince you to sing tenor yourself, hm?
You're talented enough for it.",
32119,SUPPORT,"What are you getting at? Is this an invitation from
the Mystical Songstress herself?",
32119,SUPPORT,"Male virtuosos are hard to come by. Would-be
divas are a dime a dozen, but men? Not so much.",
32119,SUPPORT,"And they have to be talented. As good as I am,
which is very talented indeed.",
32119,SUPPORT,"I think you have what it takes. If you're interested,
I can—",
32119,SUPPORT,"Sorry, but no. No way in hell am I ever doing that.",
32119,SUPPORT,"Goodness. You could have stopped at ""no.""",
32119,SUPPORT,"I can't think of anything more wretched than
getting up on a stage to sing in front of a bunch
of people.",
32119,SUPPORT,You didn't seem to mind singing for those children.,
32119,SUPPORT,"The little ones weren't feeling well and couldn't
sleep, so I sang them a lullaby to help.",
32119,SUPPORT,"That's a far cry from standing on the same stage as
you have with all those stuffy nobles staring at me.",
32119,SUPPORT,Truthfully? I'm not brave enough for it.,
32119,SUPPORT,"Rein it in, Yurikins. It's the opera, not the battlefield.
This isn't a life or death situation.",
32119,SUPPORT,"Heh heh... Fair enough. Sometimes I forget what's a
real threat and what isn't.",
32119,SUPPORT,"But I must ask you never to bring up singing again.
Not to me.",
32119,SUPPORT,Not if you want to keep things amicable between us.,
32119,SUPPORT,"How can someone that good at singing hate it
so much?",
32120,SUPPORT,"Nice to see you, Yurikins. I was wondering if you
might do me a favor.",
32120,SUPPORT,"You're looking a bit serious, ladybird. Oh...your foot.
What happened?",
32120,SUPPORT,"It's healing nicely, but I'm not supposed to put too
much weight on it.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Ah, so that's why you've called me here. What do
you need? Help with errands?",
32120,SUPPORT,Not an errand. An opera.,
32120,SUPPORT,I see.,
32120,SUPPORT,"There's been some loose plans for a performance.
Nothing professional, strictly volunteer.",
32120,SUPPORT,I signed up to take part as one of the main roles.,
32120,SUPPORT,"And then this happened. The professor told me I
should bow out, just to be on the safe side.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Makes sense to stay off your feet while you heal.
Meanwhile, you want me to fill your role, right?",
32120,SUPPORT,Got it in one! I'm glad we're on the same page here.,
32120,SUPPORT,"Surely someone else is up to the task. Professor
Manuela for example...",
32120,SUPPORT,"Surely someone else is up to the task. Why not
ask around?",
32120,SUPPORT,"Already tried. Trust me, I wouldn't ask unless I was
desperate. I knew how much you'd hate the idea.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Aside from hating it, I also wouldn't remotely sound
like you do.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Oh, don't worry about that. Most of our audience
won't be able to tell the difference.",
32120,SUPPORT,"The crowd's going to be a bunch of down-on-their-
luck children that the monastery's taken in.",
32120,SUPPORT,"The crowd's going to be a bunch of survivors and
war orphans, not your usual connoisseurs.",
32120,SUPPORT,"I'm only talking about a small festival in the plaza.
We want to give them a good show, that's all.",
32120,SUPPORT,"You have an idea of what they've been through.
I thought you might want to pitch in.",
32120,SUPPORT,Mm-hmm... I hear your angle.,
32120,SUPPORT,"Fine, fine, yes. I'll do it.",
32120,SUPPORT,Good for you. I knew you'd rise to the occasion.,
32120,SUPPORT,"You certainly know how to pull heartstrings to get
your way, don't you?",
32120,SUPPORT,"Where did you learn to do that, anyway? The opera?",
32120,SUPPORT,"Could be! I've never known a songstress who wasn't
both beautiful and resourceful.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Now, are you ready to go over the libretto? You've
got a lot of rehearsing to do before the performance.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Seriously, though... Thanks, Yurikins.",
32120,SUPPORT,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
32121,SUPPORT,"All right, Yurikins. Isn't it about time you let go
of this grudge?",
32121,SUPPORT,...,
32121,SUPPORT,"I'm sorry I dragged you out onto the stage, but I
can't believe you're still holding it against me.",
32121,SUPPORT,I bear no grudge.,
32121,SUPPORT,"Then why do you get this stony look and face the
other way any time you catch a glimpse of me?",
32121,SUPPORT,...,
32121,SUPPORT,"Oh, ladybird. Truth be told, when I see you, it
reminds me of my own self-loathing...of my past.",
32121,SUPPORT,"Huh. I didn't know you were carrying something
like that.",
32121,SUPPORT,"You rose up from your hardships and became the
lead singer for a prestigious opera, all on your own.",
32121,SUPPORT,"While I made my way through the world by licking
the boots of wretched nobles, watching you on stage
from the sidelines.",
32121,SUPPORT,"It wasn't until recently that I felt a real sense of
accomplishment in my life. But recalling that
first pivotal moment when I saw you on stage...",
32121,SUPPORT,"You were brilliant. You shone like nothing I'd ever
seen. Whenever I see you, ladybird, I'm reminded of
that moment.",
32121,SUPPORT,"And in that moment, I had never felt so filthy and
unlovable in all my life.",
32121,SUPPORT,"That's why you don't like singing? There's got to
be more to it than that.",
32121,SUPPORT,"Back then, the Imperial capital was swarming with
disgusting nobles, all of them vying for your
attention—for the love of the Dorothea.",
32121,SUPPORT,"Many were willing to compromise with an inferior
substitute. If they couldn't have you, perhaps
someone else was capable of singing just as sweetly.",
32121,SUPPORT,You do what you must to chase your dreams.,
32121,SUPPORT,"You say it left you filthy and unlovable, but my life
didn't leave me unscathed either. There's not much
love left in what I do.",
32121,SUPPORT,"There was once, of course. As a child, I lived for
singing. No matter how hard times got, I always
had that.",
32121,SUPPORT,"I counted myself so lucky to have met Manuela
and joined the opera.",
32121,SUPPORT,"But the more I sang for a living, the less certain
I was that I loved it anymore.",
32121,SUPPORT,"You're a tricky one to assess. I can't tell if you're too
wise or too naive for your own good.",
32121,SUPPORT,"Whether or not your heart's in it now, you certainly
didn't appear to hate it back then.",
32121,SUPPORT,"I'd never seen you beam so...brightly...as you did
when you helped me train for the performance.",
32121,SUPPORT,"You might be on to something. I felt...genuinely
happy in that moment.",
32121,SUPPORT,"You just lost your spark for singing. Nothing more.
It's how I feel about it, in a way.",
32121,SUPPORT,"How about this. Why not join an opera that doesn't
have dealings with nobles?",
32121,SUPPORT,"That's...a great idea, actually. We'll start something
new together. You and me.",
32121,SUPPORT,"I don't know about all that, now...",
32121,SUPPORT,"The world is full of people who fell through the
cracks, just like us.",
32121,SUPPORT,"We'll take them in whenever we can and aim to
become Fódlan's premier opera company.",
32121,SUPPORT,"I can't remember the last time I was this fired up!
Though we'll have to table it until after the war.",
32121,SUPPORT,Hm... Our own one-of-a-kind traveling opera.,
32121,SUPPORT,"You know, that does sound fairly thrilling. I've no
doubts it could help deepen our pockets.",
32121,SUPPORT,"Leave it to you to take all the romance out of it!
But I know you're an idealist deep down.",
32121,SUPPORT,"Takes one to know one. I must say, I do enjoy seeing
your mischievous side at work.",
32121,SUPPORT,"I'll take that as a compliment. I could say the same
for you too.",
32121,SUPPORT,"It's exactly why I'm comfortable sharing this dream
with you.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Mmm! Yes, it's decided. This meat is the best meat!
Although, the other inn has pretty great offerings,
as well...",
32122,SUPPORT,"Ah, if it isn't Ingrid. What are you up to in a place
like this?",
32122,SUPPORT,...,
32122,SUPPORT,Yuri! I could ask you the same...,
32122,SUPPORT,"I'm just out to send a little money to my family.
Gotta help however I can, you know?",
32122,SUPPORT,"Aww... That's very nice of you. Forgive my tone
earlier. You truly set a noble example.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Right, right. Anyhow, looked like I interrupted you.
You nearly choked on that wad of meat you were
gnawing on.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Uh, right. That...that is true, I suppose. Hmm...
You know... I... Um...",
32122,SUPPORT,What is it you're mumbling about?,
32122,SUPPORT,"Oh, uh...nothing. Anyway, you once worked for
House Rowe, didn't you?",
32122,SUPPORT,"Four years ago, when I visited Count Rowe at his
castle, I swore I saw you by his side...",
32122,SUPPORT,"Nine years ago, when I visited Count Rowe at his
castle, I swore I saw you by his side...",
32122,SUPPORT,Quite the sharp memory you have.,
32122,SUPPORT,"You aren't mistaken. I was staying there then, yes.
I had been adopted by the count.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Oh? Come to think of it, I thought I'd heard
something like that.",
32122,SUPPORT,"That the count had adopted a distant relative of
his, a young man whose future was both bright and
promising. So...that was you?",
32122,SUPPORT,"Yep. Although now I'm nothing more than a distant
stranger to him. Our ties were severed a while ago.",
32122,SUPPORT,"He helped me out by getting me into the academy.
It wasn't long after that that we started having all
sorts of...disagreements.",
32122,SUPPORT,"What the hell were you doing visiting House Rowe,
anyhow?",
32122,SUPPORT,"Ah, yes...that. How to put it. It was to help...clean up
after a friend.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Do you recall the Rowe knight by the name of
Lord Gwendal?",
32122,SUPPORT,"You see... My friend and Lord Gwendal had a...
difference of opinions.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Ah, you speak of Sylvain. Mm-hmm, that must've
been quite the mess you were cleaning up.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Well, whatever the circumstances, sounds like you
had quite the mess to clean up.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Back to the point—what are you doing out here? Do
you frequent this area often?",
32122,SUPPORT,"Mind your business, won't you? I just like to go for
walks—get fresh air. That sort of thing.",
32122,SUPPORT,Easy now. I'm not interrogating you.,
32122,SUPPORT,"Really, I just wanted to warn you that it isn't so
safe here in the evenings. You'll want to be on
your guard.",
32122,SUPPORT,"I thank you for your concern, but I assure you I can
handle myself.",
32122,SUPPORT,"Noted. Oh yeah, the innkeeper also wanted me to
thank you.",
32122,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32122,SUPPORT,"He wanted to thank you for being such an enthusiast
for the food he sells. Seemed pretty happy about it.",
32122,SUPPORT,Is that so? How very... Hm.,
32122,SUPPORT,"Well, I'd better be off!",
32122,SUPPORT,"Seems she doesn't want anyone seeing her with a
face full of food.",
32122,SUPPORT,Too late.,
32123,SUPPORT,"So? What is it, Yuri? You had me come all this way.",
32123,SUPPORT,"I need you for something. Have a seat. I won't take
much of your time.",
32123,SUPPORT,Okaaay...,
32123,SUPPORT,My apologies for keeping you waiting. Here you are!,
32123,SUPPORT,"Oh, wow! Did you...make this yourself?",
32123,SUPPORT,"I may not seem like much of a chef, but I know a
thing or two about cooking. Looks tasty, hm?",
32123,SUPPORT,"Can I, uh...eat it now? I'm famished after all
the training.",
32123,SUPPORT,Have at! That's why I asked you here.,
32123,SUPPORT,"I see! Well, thank you! Don't mind if I do!",
32123,SUPPORT,"Mmm, this dish is divine! The first bite just melts
in your mouth, and these vegetables are perfect!",
32123,SUPPORT,"The flavors are interwoven together like...like a
dance of swords between two Myrmidons!",
32123,SUPPORT,"Heh heh! Calm yourself, Ingrid. I'm in no need of
a critique. I just want you to enjoy it and take a
load off.",
32123,SUPPORT,"Aww, thank you! I will!",
32123,SUPPORT,"Whew! That was delicious, Yuri. I cannot thank
you enough.",
32123,SUPPORT,"I'm glad. Then it was worth all the toil that went into
preparing it.",
32123,SUPPORT,You...haven't eaten anything for yourself?,
32123,SUPPORT,"I figured I'd eat something a bit later. I didn't make
the meal for me.",
32123,SUPPORT,You cooked only for me?,
32123,SUPPORT,"Mm-hm. The innkeeper provided me with some of
his finest meat and told me to feed you.",
32123,SUPPORT,"I figured if I was going to do it, I'd better do it right.
So I popped into the kitchen and got working.",
32123,SUPPORT,"That won't do at all, Yuri. Meals are meant to
be shared.",
32123,SUPPORT,"It seems my stomach got the better of me this time,
though, and I scarfed everything before remembering
that.",
32123,SUPPORT,"Why bother yourself with such trivialities? The meal
was a gift.",
32123,SUPPORT,"Seeing you enjoy yourself like that is all the reward
I need.",
32123,SUPPORT,What way is that...,
32123,SUPPORT,"A bit like when you had all that meat stuffed into
your cheeks at the marketplace...like some kind of
chipmunk. Hm-hm!",
32123,SUPPORT,"I like seeing the contentment on your face when you
cut loose.",
32123,SUPPORT,You do?,
32123,SUPPORT,"The innkeeper couldn't have said it better. ""She's got
a real foodie face, that one!""",
32123,SUPPORT,I'm not quite sure how to feel...,
32123,SUPPORT,"Heh, really though! There are few things I enjoy
as much as seeing a woman indulging herself.",
32123,SUPPORT,...,
32123,SUPPORT,"You should consider your words before using them.
Such a flirtatious comment can only invite
misunderstandings.",
32123,SUPPORT,I didn't mean it that way!,
32124,SUPPORT,"Finally, you've arrived! I was beginning to get
impatient. Have a seat.",
32124,SUPPORT,What are you on about?,
32124,SUPPORT,"I'm not on about anything. Let's have dinner
together, Yuri.",
32124,SUPPORT,...What is this? Did you make it?,
32124,SUPPORT,"I did. It's a simple dish—my culinary skills are
fairly basic.",
32124,SUPPORT,Hold on. What exactly is this about?,
32124,SUPPORT,"You cook for me, I cook for you. That's how this
works.",
32124,SUPPORT,"It may not be quite as elegant a meal as that of
Adrestian or Leicester cuisine...",
32124,SUPPORT,But the food of Faerghus is delicious nonetheless.,
32124,SUPPORT,"Thank you for the meal. It was lovely, Ingrid.",
32124,SUPPORT,"The flavors were...nostalgic. Reminded me of when I
lived with my mother and the elder.",
32124,SUPPORT,"I was actually born in a poor town in Faerghus. The
flavors in this dish remind me of those days.",
32124,SUPPORT,"Eh, sorry. I didn't mean to compare a meal made by
nobility with the meager food I grew up eating.",
32124,SUPPORT,"No offense taken. To tell the truth, although my
house is a noble one, it's also lacking in money.",
32124,SUPPORT,"Our territory was struck by famine, and we ate
whatever the land gave us...which wasn't much. We
took what we could, just like everyone.",
32124,SUPPORT,"I see... Well, I must say that your cooking is quite to
my taste.",
32124,SUPPORT,"Any meal made with so much thought and care is
bound to be delicious.",
32124,SUPPORT,"Heh heh! Why, thank you! High praise, indeed, from
someone who knows their way around a kitchen.",
32124,SUPPORT,"To survive in this world means to sharpen many
skills. Whether it's cooking or anything else, really.",
32124,SUPPORT,"Although, I've got to say, I do enjoy cooking. And if
my meals can bring a smile to someone's face, all
the better.",
32124,SUPPORT,"Celebrating victories with friends, sitting around a
table with loved ones, watching someone enjoy the
meal I made them...",
32124,SUPPORT,Few things bring me more joy.,
32124,SUPPORT,"Have you ever considered giving up being the lord of
the underworld and becoming a chef instead?",
32124,SUPPORT,"Heh... A chef, huh? You know, that doesn't sound
half bad.",
32124,SUPPORT,"If you ever do, I'd come to your restaurant and eat
whatever you'd whipped up every day!",
32124,SUPPORT,"I'd like that very much. I'd work extra hard so I
could see that lovely smile of yours.",
32124,SUPPORT,"You are just too much! I can hardly maintain my
composure around you...",
32124,SUPPORT,Did I say something wrong?,
32124,SUPPORT,"Not at all, Yuri. Not at all.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Oh, Constance. Hey. Um... Sure is sunny out, huh?
Yeah...",
32125,SUPPORT,"Good day to you, Balthus.",
32125,SUPPORT,"You seem to be enjoying your freedom. I must admit
I'm jealous.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Right. Uh... So yeah, the weather's nice, heh.
I gotta be going now.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Of course. What profit is there for one so exalted
to spend time alongside one so common as me?",
32125,SUPPORT,"Worry not. You needn't suffer me any longer. I shall
see myself off.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Come on, don't be like that. You know I get
uncomfortable at times like this. I'm trying. Really.",
32125,SUPPORT,"You matter—so stick around, yeah? Let's...chat.
It'll be great.",
32125,SUPPORT,"You needn't take pity on me out of the sense of
obligation that your status demands.",
32125,SUPPORT,"For you, the nobility that you abandoned was a
shackle on your true self, which is now freed.",
32125,SUPPORT,"No need to converse with me any longer, putting
yourself out on my behalf.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Quite a mouthful you just unloaded on me. Not sure
what you mean by that nobility stuff, though.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Sure, I walked out on leading a noble house. But how
do you imagine that's related to this chat of ours?",
32125,SUPPORT,"I already admitted I'm no good with stuff like
this, but I don't think I'm ""putting myself out""
or whatever.",
32125,SUPPORT,"My apologies. The misunderstanding was entirely
my own.",
32125,SUPPORT,"As I suspected from the start, I am unfit to serve as
your conversational partner.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Ahh, that's enough! Stop talking that way and
twisting everything I say!",
32125,SUPPORT,"Just spit it out and tell me something real. You hate
my guts, yeah?",
32125,SUPPORT,"Huh, this is novel! But doesn't this scene usually play
out in reverse?",
32125,SUPPORT,"Ah, sorry. Guess I raised my voice there. But what do
you mean by that ""reverse"" dig?",
32125,SUPPORT,"Well, it's usually her yelling at you while you try to
deflect. It's rare to see you lose your cool while she
stays so calm.",
32125,SUPPORT,"But different people get along differently on different
days, I suppose. Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Ouch. He has a point. I lost myself for a
moment there.",
32125,SUPPORT,To think that I have ever raised my voice at you...,
32125,SUPPORT,He seems to think we're real pals.,
32125,SUPPORT,"Honestly, whether rain or shine, I don't think a day's
gone by without you treating me poorly.",
32125,SUPPORT,Oh! What a thing to say!,
32125,SUPPORT,"I could never go so far as to insult one with
your lineage.",
32125,SUPPORT,"Ha! You're a funny one, pal. A real hoot!",
32125,SUPPORT,"The idea that I could be amusing is funnier than
any jest I may have uttered. Haha...haha...",
32126,SUPPORT,"What's with all the ruckus, I wonder? Wait...
Isn't that Constance?",
32126,SUPPORT,"This has nothing to do with you, so keep your nose
out of it!",
32126,SUPPORT,"Yeah, none of your business! Unless you're his
girlfriend, that is! Heh.",
32126,SUPPORT,"You ascribe too much to me, sirs. I haven't the
qualities that Balthus seeks in a partner.",
32126,SUPPORT,So prissy! You Balthus's lady or not?,
32126,SUPPORT,"Softly, please, softly! Such accusations are slander
upon his good name.",
32126,SUPPORT,"I have no place in the heart of one so freewheeling
and glad.",
32126,SUPPORT,"Were there a list of suitable partners, I should deem
myself to be at the tail end of it.",
32126,SUPPORT,"If you're not his gal, then step off. We're trying to
spread some juicy Balthus gossip over here.",
32126,SUPPORT,"You're nothing to him, so why ruin our fun?",
32126,SUPPORT,Because what you say is unthinkable.,
32126,SUPPORT,"If you attempt to spread lies that strain credulity so,
it will be your own reputations that suffer.",
32126,SUPPORT,"Your reputations or your bones, should Balthus
ever learn of this deception.",
32126,SUPPORT,"A hairline break may heal, but the powder he makes
of a man's skeleton is another matter...",
32126,SUPPORT,"And that's to say nothing of the jelly that will be left
of your organs. Are you not concerned?",
32126,SUPPORT,"He'll do what?! Oh, um, guess spreading lies is a
bad idea. Good thing I'd never do such a thing!",
32126,SUPPORT,"Uh, right! This is all a big misunderstanding.
Thanks for the heads-up!",
32126,SUPPORT,"We're just gonna back away now. Um, have a
nice day!",
32126,SUPPORT,Whew. I've saved lives today.,
32126,SUPPORT,"They didn't deserve the fury that he would unleash.
But then, few would... Hm?",
32126,SUPPORT,Is that not Balthus standing there?,
32126,SUPPORT,"Hey! Why did you say all that scary stuff about me?!
Don't tell people things like that!",
32126,SUPPORT,"They're not the ones ruining my reputation—
you are!",
32126,SUPPORT,"Oh, how shortsighted of me...",
32126,SUPPORT,"I believed myself to be acting in your interest, but I
see now that I was mistaken.",
32126,SUPPORT,I shall regret this indiscretion until my dying day.,
32126,SUPPORT,"Clearly I need to take anything that falls out of your
mouth with a grain of salt. Maybe the whole shaker.",
32126,SUPPORT,"Still, you did stop those two from talking about me.",
32126,SUPPORT,"Regardless of how you did it, I guess I should
be grateful. So...thanks.",
32126,SUPPORT,"This magnanimity is in keeping with the wondrous
man I know you to be.",
32126,SUPPORT,"So open, so accepting... You are a paragon for
others to follow.",
32126,SUPPORT,"Sheesh, maybe it's better when she treats me poorly.
Being praised like that is downright uncomfortable...",
32127,SUPPORT,Hyah! Come at me!,
32127,SUPPORT,"Balthus, you mustn't draw the enemy in so. Pray do
not sacrifice yourself on my account.",
32127,SUPPORT,Enough of that! Just watch my back like we planned!,
32127,SUPPORT,"A thousand pardons, then.",
32127,SUPPORT,"Phew! It's been a while since we had such
a close fight.",
32127,SUPPORT,"How are you holding up? You didn't seem like your
heart was really in it this time.",
32127,SUPPORT,"I had some difficulty, knowing the torment our
enemy was going through.",
32127,SUPPORT,"Bad enough to fall in combat, but to be felled by
one so base as I...",
32127,SUPPORT,"If they regret anything, it's that you're worried about
their humiliating defeat. Ego burn, right there.",
32127,SUPPORT,"You know, it wasn't so bad fighting at your side.
We make a pretty good team, you and I.",
32127,SUPPORT,"It is because you have the courage to face your
enemies head on, leaving your flanks unguarded.",
32127,SUPPORT,"And the generosity to allow less skilled fighters the
glory of dispatching foes who take the bait.",
32127,SUPPORT,"Every aspect of your tactics is a reflection of your
incomparable virtue.",
32127,SUPPORT,"You have a way of understanding a situation, but also
twisting it all up in your head. Impressive, really.",
32127,SUPPORT,"The Unrivaled King of Grappling himself—that'd
be me—trusted you enough to watch his back.
Can't you just be proud and leave it at that?",
32127,SUPPORT,"The nickname is a difficult one to respect, though
the man inhabiting it is more than worthy.",
32127,SUPPORT,Hmph.,
32127,SUPPORT,"If what I have said today has offended, which I would
not doubt, then accept my humblest apologies.",
32127,SUPPORT,"Ha! You really are something else, you know that?
I like your style, pal.",
32127,SUPPORT,"I could see us teaming up as mercenaries and
wandering from battlefield to battlefield.",
32127,SUPPORT,"Admit it, that would be a grand old time.
Don't you think?",
32127,SUPPORT,"It would...depend on the circumstances. Might I
impose on you to come with me?",
32127,SUPPORT,"Right, there's always... Wait, what?",
32127,SUPPORT,"OK, we're here. Care to explain?",
32127,SUPPORT,"Must you make a mockery of everything?! I have my
own dream to pursue, not this twaddle!",
32127,SUPPORT,"You assume I'd abandon the restoration of House
Nuvelle to...to become a vagrant?! Are you mad?",
32127,SUPPORT,"Even among your fabled transgressions, this goes
beyond the pale!",
32127,SUPPORT,"Definitely a fair-weather friend, that one...",
32128,SUPPORT,"...scampered up to me, hopped in my lap, and scarfed
it all down in one bite.",
32128,SUPPORT,Ha! That sounds terrible!,
32128,SUPPORT,"I was looking forward to that sandwich all morning.
And then she scurried off like nothing happened.",
32128,SUPPORT,Hrrmm!,
32128,SUPPORT,...,
32128,SUPPORT,"Ahhh, hm. All right, then. What do you feel like
doing today?",
32128,SUPPORT,Why'd you sigh like that?,
32128,SUPPORT,"That's not a problem, is it? I could tell you were
holding back a real monstrous sigh yourself.",
32128,SUPPORT,Figured I'd get one out for the both of us. Felt great.,
32128,SUPPORT,"Oh, I see. Must be nice, sighing whenever you feel
so inclined.",
32128,SUPPORT,"Ooh! Why not try taking a deep breath whenever
you feel a sigh coming on? Trick yourself out of it?",
32128,SUPPORT,"I tried that once. It went OK at first, but then I had
to exhale.",
32128,SUPPORT,"Right. Guess they're too similar for that to work.
Does that mean yawning is a no-go too?",
32128,SUPPORT,"I'm pretty bored right now, so maybe we'll find out.",
32128,SUPPORT,"But I don't yawn very often, to be honest.",
32128,SUPPORT,"Because you sleep when the sun goes down and wake
when it rises, yeah?",
32128,SUPPORT,Yup. That's been my routine for a while now.,
32128,SUPPORT,"It's easier than contending with a full day of
boring stuff.",
32128,SUPPORT,"Come on, everything has its quirks. I don't think I'd
call anything in this wild world boring.",
32128,SUPPORT,"Really? 'Cause you don't seem to take much interest
in your own future.",
32128,SUPPORT,"Ha! That's not very nice, is it?",
32128,SUPPORT,"We really aren't all that different, you know.
I'd wager you haven't given too much thought
to tomorrow either.",
32128,SUPPORT,Quiet. Don't pretend you can see through me.,
32128,SUPPORT,"This pointless chatter has made me even hungrier
than I already was. I'm off to the dining hall.",
32128,SUPPORT,Just wanted the gal to relax for a change.,
32128,SUPPORT,Whew... She's as prickly as ever.,
32129,SUPPORT,"What's all this? Ha! I knew it! Would you look
at that—it's gold!",
32129,SUPPORT,"Some poor sap just left it here for me to find.
Heh, I'll be taking this, then.",
32129,SUPPORT,"You think the whole world is your collection jar.
Unbelievable...",
32129,SUPPORT,"Ah... Um, sorry about that.",
32129,SUPPORT,"Look, I feel awful. Please don't twist up your face like
you're suppressing a disappointed sigh.",
32129,SUPPORT,"How about I use this gold to buy you something
nice? A sweet treat, perhaps? Yeah?",
32129,SUPPORT,"I don't eat contraband sweets. Are you trying to get
me locked up again?",
32129,SUPPORT,"Give back the money or don't. It's none of my
business. Either way, keep me out of it.",
32129,SUPPORT,"As you wish, milady. Straight to the fun fund it goes.
Drinks don't buy themselves, unfortunately.",
32129,SUPPORT,"That might make for a fun night or two. But what
about all the money you owe?",
32129,SUPPORT,"If you're going to keep this, you should apply it to
your debts before a bounty hunter gets ahold of you.",
32129,SUPPORT,"This gold wouldn't even make a dent. It's chump
change. Better to drink it than waste it.",
32129,SUPPORT,"In any case, when I'm dead, I'm dead. When that
happens, none of this will matter anymore.",
32129,SUPPORT,"I'm not going to worry about what I can't control.
I've got better uses for this gold in the meantime.",
32129,SUPPORT,"I don't understand how you can be so reckless.
It's as though you want to get killed.",
32129,SUPPORT,"Meanwhile, if I lose control for even a moment,
monsters will eat me for dinner.",
32129,SUPPORT,"Hearing you say that so casually feels like a bad
omen. It's unsettling, that's for sure.",
32129,SUPPORT,"Sorry, is that too morbid for you? You just told me,
""When I'm dead, I'm dead.""",
32129,SUPPORT,And it's true. For me. Not for you.,
32129,SUPPORT,And why is that?,
32129,SUPPORT,"Because all of this mess I'm drowning in is my own
fault. Every bit of it. You can't say the same.",
32129,SUPPORT,"I'm in trouble because I borrowed, drank, and fought
too much.",
32129,SUPPORT,"All my own choices. That means it's on me to take
responsibility and accept the inevitable outcome.",
32129,SUPPORT,"So...since it's in my control to keep the sighs at bay,
I don't get to relax ever?",
32129,SUPPORT,"Err, not quite. I'm sayin' that it isn't your fault,
so you shouldn't have to bear that burden alone.",
32129,SUPPORT,"That's a nice sentiment. But people are hardly lining
up to share this burden with me.",
32129,SUPPORT,"Talk is cheap. Everyone knows it's all over the
instant I sigh.",
32129,SUPPORT,"Huh. I have a habit of not saying the right thing
to her. Not much I can do abo—",
32129,SUPPORT,"Hey, it's more gold! Go ahead and join your buddies
in my pocket, pal.",
32130,SUPPORT,Why did you bring me here? It's so isolated.,
32130,SUPPORT,That would be the point.,
32130,SUPPORT,"Yikes. See you around, B.",
32130,SUPPORT,"Hang on a second. Out here, in a place like this,
you should be free to sigh, yeah?",
32130,SUPPORT,What do you mean by that?,
32130,SUPPORT,"I just thought it would do you well to cut loose
and sigh to your heart's content.",
32130,SUPPORT,Really?,
32130,SUPPORT,"You found a nice, quiet place where you could annoy
me without putting bystanders at risk?",
32130,SUPPORT,"Aah, why does this always happen? That's not what
I meant. This is me doing something nice for you.",
32130,SUPPORT,"You said before that you can't ever relax because
you're worried about endangering others.",
32130,SUPPORT,"A lot's been going on recently. So let 'er rip already.
Sigh until you can sigh no more!",
32130,SUPPORT,That's...nice of you.,
32130,SUPPORT,"A chance to relax and sigh as I please. Sounds good.
But what do we do about the monsters?",
32130,SUPPORT,"What do you think? A monster shows up, I punch
it in the nose. Done deal.",
32130,SUPPORT,By yourself?,
32130,SUPPORT,"I'm never alone, pal. These two fists are always by
my side, and they never let me down.",
32130,SUPPORT,"Oh, right.",
32130,SUPPORT,"It doesn't have to be here if you have performance
anxiety. But anytime you accidentally call a monster,
just holler and I'll punch it to next Tuesday.",
32130,SUPPORT,"In fact, maybe it's best if you just stick by my side
from now on.",
32130,SUPPORT,"Do that, and you're free to sigh whenever the
urge strikes.",
32130,SUPPORT,Why would I have to stay by your side?,
32130,SUPPORT,"Not a lot of people in this world can knock out a
beast without breaking a sweat. I'm one of 'em.",
32130,SUPPORT,"And since I'm always on the run from bounty
hunters, I'm an exceptionally light sleeper.",
32130,SUPPORT,You expect me to sleep by your side too?,
32130,SUPPORT,"Ooh, this may be my best idea yet...",
32130,SUPPORT,"If I'm always with a monster summoner, fewer people
will come after my bounty! Heh, this is brilliant...",
32130,SUPPORT,"*sigh* You never change, B.",
32130,SUPPORT,"You're so predictable. *sigh* All right, have fun.",
32130,SUPPORT,Have fun? That's an odd thing to— AH!,
32130,SUPPORT,Raaaaaaargh!,
32130,SUPPORT,"Monsters! They're everywhere! Heh, this is gonna be
a blast.",
32130,SUPPORT,It's hard not to like that dummy.,
32131,SUPPORT,"Hey there, Claude. Where are you headed?
If you need some extra muscle, count me in.",
32131,SUPPORT,"No thanks. Not much need for heightened security
at the monastery. Well, most of the time anyway.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Yeesh, I can take a hint. I was just trying to help
you out.",
32131,SUPPORT,"The way I see it, can't do better than cozying up to
the Claude von Riegan, future leader of the Alliance.",
32131,SUPPORT,"The way I see it, can't do much better than cozying
up to the Claude von Riegan, leader of the Alliance.",
32131,SUPPORT,"You can get as cozy as you like, but I don't think
that'll lower the price on your head.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Couldn't hurt. People trust you. They trust the folks
you run with. I could use a little trust in my life.",
32131,SUPPORT,"So you're hoping this newfound trust will trick more
people into lending you money. Yeah, count me out.
You know fighting debt with debt won't work, right?",
32131,SUPPORT,"Eh, just as well. If you mess up leading the Alliance,
that plan's a bust anyway. So count me out, pal.",
32131,SUPPORT,"By the way, Claude... Are you really the heir of
House Riegan?",
32131,SUPPORT,"Yes? That's my current understanding anyway.
Why do you ask?",
32131,SUPPORT,"I've never heard any talk of the last Duke Riegan
leaving a son behind when he died in that accident.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Duke Oswald the Old...your father? Tall tale,
if you ask me.",
32131,SUPPORT,"And if that's not the case, then who exactly did you
get your Riegan blood from?",
32131,SUPPORT,"Look at you, figuring things out all by yourself.
Sorry to say the true story isn't all that interesting.",
32131,SUPPORT,"I was born to an offshoot of House Riegen. When my
Crest manifested, I was accepted into the ruling
bloodline. That's all there is to it.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Nice try, but I'm not buying it. House Riegan
produces dukes and leads the whole of the Alliance.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Not having an heir is a matter of life and death. Any
relative with a Crest would be accepted immediately.",
32131,SUPPORT,"But no one even knew you existed until fairly
recently. It's fishy, Claude. Remarkably fishy.",
32131,SUPPORT,"I think I've finally figured you out. You're working
for Lorenz, aren't you?",
32131,SUPPORT,"I think I've finally figured you out. You're working
for House Gloucester, aren't you?",
32131,SUPPORT,"Here's what I really can't work out. Duke Oswald's
only daughter, Tiana. Whatever happened to her?",
32131,SUPPORT,"I met her a few times when I was a kid. She was a
great lady. A real looker too, let me tell ya.",
32131,SUPPORT,"I see your mind was just as pure when you were a kid
as it is now. How'd you even cross paths with her?",
32131,SUPPORT,"As the legitimate heir of a minor noble house, I got
a pretty decent glimpse into high society.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Lady Tiana was something special. The stuff of
dreams, really.",
32131,SUPPORT,"And one day, she just vanished. Poof, gone. I'll never
forget hearing about it.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Wow. So you've had a particular interest in older
women since way back when. Sorry, go on.",
32131,SUPPORT,"When my old man told me, I cried buckets.
Even Holst lost it.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Holst? As in Holst the indomitable Alliance general?
Huh. I never knew that.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Yeah...and after a while, I heard a strange rumor.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Some say Lady Tiana left to live in a far-off land.
Once I remembered that, the rest fell into place.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Right. Say, have you considered minding your own
business? Isn't that enough of a handful as it is?",
32131,SUPPORT,"If you want to have a real discussion sometime,
bring me facts. Not a bunch of tired gossip. Deal?",
32131,SUPPORT,"Anyway, Teach is waiting for me at the training
grounds, so I'd better get going.",
32131,SUPPORT,"Heh. Nice try, Claude, but I'm on to you...",
32132,SUPPORT,"Hey, Claude! Care to pick up where we left off?
I got some time to kill.",
32132,SUPPORT,"You'll have to kill time on your own, I'm afraid.
My calendar's full at the moment.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Aw, don't be like that. You're not afraid I'm gonna
expose your true identity, are you? I would never!",
32132,SUPPORT,"Besides, my own bloodline isn't so lofty that I can get
away with something like that.",
32132,SUPPORT,"I bet your father would just love to hear you say that.
And the Albrecht family is from a distinguished
noble house, so I'm not sure what you mean.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Not as distinguished as you would think. And my
mom wasn't born a noble.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Ah, the plot thickens. So your mother was a
commoner, then?",
32132,SUPPORT,"In a sense...but it's complicated. Listen up and
I'll tell you a little story.",
32132,SUPPORT,"You know Kupala, yeah? Those folks have been
living in the mountains of Fódlan's Throat for ages.",
32132,SUPPORT,"I know it well. Tales of that place were carried on
the wind to where I grew up. Here's my favorite...",
32132,SUPPORT,"In a land surrounded by tall mountains, untouched
by civilization, lies a hidden village.",
32132,SUPPORT,"The people who live there, the mystical Kupala
tribe... They say that an ancient and powerful
bloodline runs through their veins to this very day.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Don't try to find them, people say, or you're liable to
get hexed. Or so the tale goes.",
32132,SUPPORT,"That part was probably added to spice up the story a
bit, but even so, they're certainly a mysterious lot.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Heh. They don't leave their homeland too often, so
it's only natural that strange rumors would arise.",
32132,SUPPORT,"And your mother...is she really some kind of
Kupala princess or something?",
32132,SUPPORT,"Not a princess, but she was born and raised there.
She left, got lost, and was rescued. By my dad.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Ah... He fell head over heels for her. Made her his
wife. That's when her troubles really started.",
32132,SUPPORT,Did your father tell anyone where she was from?,
32132,SUPPORT,"Of course not. But it didn't matter. She was still a
stranger of questionable lineage.",
32132,SUPPORT,"The family treated her horribly. That eventually
led to them splitting up and my dad remarrying.",
32132,SUPPORT,"That's not an uncommon circumstance for a noble
house. Where is she now?",
32132,SUPPORT,"With nowhere else to turn, she went back to Kupala,
even though my pops tried to convince her to stay.",
32132,SUPPORT,"I'm guessing you two left for much the same reason.
Too hard to put up with the foul treatment, right?",
32132,SUPPORT,"That's part of it. If my mom had been Fódlan
nobility, my life would have been very different.",
32132,SUPPORT,"So, what do you think? Did I drum up some
empathy? After all, half of your blood comes from—",
32132,SUPPORT,"I hear you, Balthus. Can't say I don't empathize,
though our circumstances are pretty different.",
32132,SUPPORT,"So you admit it, then? Heh, I knew I was right about
you. My instincts are second to none.",
32132,SUPPORT,"Your instincts, right. Look, if it makes you happy,
you just go on believing whatever you want.",
32132,SUPPORT,"I'll do just that. Say, Claude... It'd be a shame if your
true identity was exposed, yeah? A real shame.",
32132,SUPPORT,"I'm thinking you'd better...set up a meeting between
me and your mom. She was my first crush, after all.",
32132,SUPPORT,"I had it bad for her back in the day. I'm still haunted
by the fact that I never had the chance to tell her.",
32132,SUPPORT,"That's...bothersome. And that aside, you do know
that time didn't exactly stop for her, right?",
32132,SUPPORT,"Not a problem, pal. Age IS beauty.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Balthus! You and I are of like minds, so I'd like to
get your opinion on something.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Oh, is this about the age thing? As a rule, so long
as she's younger than my own mother, it's fair
game, pal.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Noted. But that's not what I wanted to talk about.
Ever, really.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Do you remember what I said, about the first thing
we need to accomplish in this war?",
32133,SUPPORT,"That bit about busting open the lid that keeps the
people of Fódlan from the rest of the world?",
32133,SUPPORT,"That's right. I'd like to know your thoughts on
the matter.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Um, 'K. Well, everyone seemed to eat it up, so I'm
fine with it too. Certainly not against it.",
32133,SUPPORT,"In a world like that, my mom wouldn't have to fear
what others think of her.",
32133,SUPPORT,"But it all hinges on if you can shape reality into the
vision you have in mind. That's no small task.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Hm. I had a feeling you'd say something like that.
Please, go on.",
32133,SUPPORT,"I'm all for mixing up different ways of life and
bloodlines, but who knows what it'll really mean
for Fódlan?",
32133,SUPPORT,"We'll be free from things that previously bound us.
Walls will crumble. Things will change...drastically.",
32133,SUPPORT,"At the same time, the world we've defended for years
could easily become unrecognizable. Everything
we've built up until now could fall to ash.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Hard to say how it'll all shake out. All we can do is
wait and see. Maybe all will end well. Or maybe not.",
32133,SUPPORT,"All I want is for everyone to accept each other.
That's the ideal I'm striving for. It's deceptively
simple, when you think about it.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Look, if getting exactly what you wanted was easy,
I'd be drowning in gold.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Don't get caught up in the stakes. You just have to
throw the dice and see where they fall.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Good advice. That's all we can ever do, really.
I just have to do my best and prepare for the worst.",
32133,SUPPORT,"You got it. I can't help with funding, obviously,
but you have my support.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Speaking of funds... You're not planning to sell the
secrets of my origins for a quick payoff, right?",
32133,SUPPORT,"There are people with deep pockets who'd love to
see me fall. They'd pay well for information like that.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Haha! Don't worry, Claude. I wouldn't sell out
a friend, not even for a small fortune. Most likely.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Heh, I was just kidding. After all, I have that promise
to look forward to. You won't let me down, right?",
32133,SUPPORT,"Oh, of course not. And that promise was...what
exactly?",
32133,SUPPORT,"How about hooking me up with your mom! After we
bust open that lid, of course.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Of course. Uh, age difference aside, you know she's
married, right?",
32133,SUPPORT,"I'm not a loon, Claude. I'm not trying to marry her!
I just want some closure with my childhood crush.",
32133,SUPPORT,"Is that a fact? Well, it'll be interesting to see whether
my father can kill you before my mother beats him
to it.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Hilda! Be a dear and spot me some gold, will ya?",
32134,SUPPORT,"Slow down, Baltie. You can't be asking for money
without so much as a hello. You're kidding, right?",
32134,SUPPORT,"Kidding. Yeah... Thing is, I was deadly serious.
I don't joke about matters of gold.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Ugh. Your request is denied. You didn't use to be
like this, you know.",
32134,SUPPORT,"I get the feeling you don't mean anything good by
that. But come on, I'm the same as I ever was.",
32134,SUPPORT,No. You used to be dependable.,
32134,SUPPORT,"Like that time in the woods near Fódlan's Throat.
You remember?",
32134,SUPPORT,"Thinking, thinking... Are you sure that was me?",
32134,SUPPORT,"Yes! Ugh. I had told Holst I wanted to go on a walk
in the forest.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Heh, Holst never could tell you ""no.""",
32134,SUPPORT,"Hm, few can. Anyway, when the three of us got
there, a horde of monsters appeared. I started
wailing.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Then what happened?",
32134,SUPPORT,"My brother started hitting one of the beasts with a
wooden sword. You hoisted me over your shoulder.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Holst told you to get me to safety, even if it killed
you.",
32134,SUPPORT,"So you ran the whole way from the forest to the
estate with me on your back.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Ah! I remember it now. Toughest run of my life.
I was so exhausted, I threw up about a month's
worth of lunches afterward.",
32134,SUPPORT,"And then you turned right around and started
running back. You said, ""I've gotta save Holst!""",
32134,SUPPORT,"A good thing too. Holst was moments from winding
up in that thing's stomach.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Had to slam into it, then Holst and I kept punching
till the deed was done! Truly a fight to remember.",
32134,SUPPORT,"It was impressive, especially considering you were
just teenagers.",
32134,SUPPORT,"When you came back...you were just bruised boys in
tattered clothes. But to me, you looked like heroes.",
32134,SUPPORT,"And now, here you are, a scrounger who can hardly
open his mouth without nagging me for money.",
32134,SUPPORT,"What happened to that brave little boy who saved
me from a monster?",
32134,SUPPORT,"Wow. Way to shame a guy. I feel awful...but I still
need gold. Can't live without it in this cruel world.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Oh, come on. We both know that when you have
money, you drink or gamble it all away.",
32134,SUPPORT,"But I suppose I could ask my brother to help pay off
your debts. Get you back on your feet.",
32134,SUPPORT,Don't you dare speak to Holst about this!,
32134,SUPPORT,"He's a close friend. I'd hate to ruin what we have by
borrowing gold.",
32134,SUPPORT,"Oh! But you have no qualms about using his little
sister? Figured I'd be an easy mark, is that it?
Unbelievable.",
32134,SUPPORT,That...coulda gone better.,
32135,SUPPORT,"Whoa! Easy there, big guy. I'm fragile, you know.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Stand back, Hilda! I've got this!",
32135,SUPPORT,"Whew. Thanks for the help, Baltie. Are you OK?",
32135,SUPPORT,"What, this? It's noth— Argh!",
32135,SUPPORT,"Ouch. You didn't have to do that, you know. I didn't
ask you to get yourself beaten up.",
32135,SUPPORT,"If I thought I might have to break a sweat, I'd have
gotten out of there myself.",
32135,SUPPORT,"I know, I know. But I can't help but worry when
I see you in a tight spot.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Holst told me to keep an eye on you and all.
It's the least I can do.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Huh. I didn't realize you were still in touch with
my brother.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Nah, this was ages ago. Told me if anything
happened to him, it was up to me to look after you.",
32135,SUPPORT,"What could possibly happen to Holst?
He's indestructible.",
32135,SUPPORT,"True. But what would he think if I let you get hurt
when I could've saved you? Not on my watch, pal.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Ha, good point. He'd kill you.",
32135,SUPPORT,"It's a real concern. I may be the Renowned King of
Grappling, but I still wouldn't want to take on Holst.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Haha! He'd tear you to pieces... But if you did get
killed trying to protect me, Holst would be crushed.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Not as crushed as if something happened to me.
But still, he'd be broken up about it.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Maybe so. But in that case, at least he wouldn't think
I'd messed up.",
32135,SUPPORT,"As much as I believe in Holst, he also believes in me.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Because of that, I won't ever let him down.
And on that note...",
32135,SUPPORT,"Even if you think I'm in over my head, don't worry
about it. I'd like for you to believe in me too.",
32135,SUPPORT,"I can't stop worrying about you on command.
That's not how worrying works.",
32135,SUPPORT,"Heh, fair. But I do what I do because I want to.
If it lands me beneath the dirt sooner than later,
well, save your tears for my funeral.",
32135,SUPPORT,"I hate when people talk about death like it's no big
deal. Try to keep your stupid heart beating, all right?",
32136,SUPPORT,Hyah! Ha! Hiiiyah!,
32136,SUPPORT,"Baltie? Still training at this hour? How unexpectedly
diligent of you.",
32136,SUPPORT,"Ah, Hilda! How are things? Anything...of note
to report?",
32136,SUPPORT,Um...no? I'm not sure what you mean.,
32136,SUPPORT,"Oh, I don't know. You haven't been approached by
any lovelorn goons lately, have you?",
32136,SUPPORT,"Hmm, now that you mention it, it's been a few days
since any guys have flirted with me.",
32136,SUPPORT,Fantastic. They got the hint.,
32136,SUPPORT,"Whoa, whoa, wait a second. Are you pulling some
weird prank on me?",
32136,SUPPORT,"Of course not. I'm just doing my best to keep my
promise to Holst, that's all.",
32136,SUPPORT,"Oh, not this again. That was ages ago! I'm sure
my brother's forgotten all about it.",
32136,SUPPORT,"Dead wrong, pal. I actually had the chance to see
him recently, and he had a new request for me.",
32136,SUPPORT,"What? He told you to get rid of any guys who show
interest in me, so that I stay his innocent little
sister forever?",
32136,SUPPORT,"That's extreme, Hilda. You really think he'd do
something like that?",
32136,SUPPORT,"That sounds more like Seteth than Holst,
don't you think?",
32136,SUPPORT,"Mm, fair point. What was the request?",
32136,SUPPORT,"Guys here have the gall to consider you a potential
bride. It's my job to test 'em. See if they're worthy.",
32136,SUPPORT,I don't like where this is going.,
32136,SUPPORT,"Since Holst isn't here to do the honors, I've spread
the word that nobody is fit to marry you unless they
can defeat the Great King of Grappling in a fight.",
32136,SUPPORT,"What?! That's exactly the same as getting rid
of them!",
32136,SUPPORT,"How so? It only eliminates the guys who are dumb
enough to take up the challenge.",
32136,SUPPORT,"No one is that dumb. No one around here thinks
they can beat the Stupendous King of Grappling
or whatever.",
32136,SUPPORT,"That's why I leveled the playing field by allowing
sneak attacks. Plenty have already tried their luck.",
32136,SUPPORT,One guy actually tried to strangle me in my sleep.,
32136,SUPPORT,"Wow, a sleep-strangler. He sounds like husband
material.",
32136,SUPPORT,"And that's why I've been training so much. Can't let
you end up with some weakling, after all.",
32136,SUPPORT,"This is madness! If you keep getting stronger, there
won't be anyone who fits the bill!",
32136,SUPPORT,"True. You could spend your whole life searching
and never find a match for Balthus the Great.",
32136,SUPPORT,"The only people who stand a chance are Holst...
and me! Heh!",
32136,SUPPORT,"To prove that you're worthy of my hand in marriage,
you're going to fight...yourself?",
32136,SUPPORT,"I always knew I was my own worst enemy. One day,
I'll finally meet my equal in battle. Me.",
32136,SUPPORT,"Haha! So you're going to punch yourself out? Is that
your idea of a romantic gesture?",
32136,SUPPORT,"When that fateful day arrives, Hilda, I want you to
know that I intend to keep my word.",
32136,SUPPORT,"Huh. A girl could do worse, I suppose.",
32137,SUPPORT,"Ugh, training was exhausting today. Need some
quick energy. Aha! Perfect time for my favorite
candy!",
32137,SUPPORT,"I won't make it back to my room without this sweet,
sweet energy, and no one's around, soooo...",
32137,SUPPORT,Mmm... Mmm...,
32137,SUPPORT,"Lookee here! It's the little lady of House Ordelia.
Just back from training, yeah? You're unstoppable.",
32137,SUPPORT,Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...,
32137,SUPPORT,"Not feeling chatty, I see. Something to do with those
puffy cheeks? Got a cavity brewing, or what?",
32137,SUPPORT,I definitely don't!,
32137,SUPPORT,"So bad you can't even speak properly. Poor thing.
It's OK, I know a guy. He'll have that rotten tooth
out in no time.",
32137,SUPPORT,No need!,
32137,SUPPORT,"Yep. Best in the business. Uses special tools and
everything. Door and a string or some such.",
32137,SUPPORT,No! No! Thank you!,
32137,SUPPORT,"Ah. You just had food in your mouth. You could
have told me that a lot sooner, you know.",
32137,SUPPORT,"Wow. Placing the blame on me? What a piece of
work. But, uh...hey. Don't tell anyone.",
32137,SUPPORT,"That you were walking around with acorn-stuffed
cheeks like some kind of overzealous squirrel?",
32137,SUPPORT,Ugh! It wasn't acorns. It was candy!,
32137,SUPPORT,"Even still, I don't plan on telling anyone a hungry
girl ate some food. Not much of a story, really.",
32137,SUPPORT,"You don't get it. If people think I'm gnawing on
candy, they'll think I'm nothing more than a child.",
32137,SUPPORT,"That a fact? I'd say it's downright prudent to fortify
yourself any chance you get. Mature, even.",
32137,SUPPORT,Wait... What?,
32137,SUPPORT,"Nothing is certain in life, not even your next meal.
You never know when you'll be taken into custody
and have to go without food and drink for a while.",
32137,SUPPORT,"Just what kind of a world do you inhabit, mister?",
32137,SUPPORT,"The real world, little lady. My life is a collection of
getting into trouble, getting caught, and getting free.",
32137,SUPPORT,"My life is a collection of getting into trouble,
getting caught, and getting free.",
32137,SUPPORT,"One time I was actually rescued by your parents.
Bet you didn't know that, eh?",
32137,SUPPORT,They...rescued you?,
32137,SUPPORT,"Too true. I owe them for that. I... Gah! I forgot I'm
actually in a rush.",
32137,SUPPORT,"I gotta run. Enjoy your secret candy, pal.",
32137,SUPPORT,"Mother and Father rescued that guy? But when
would that have happened?",
32138,SUPPORT,"Balthus, do you have a moment?",
32138,SUPPORT,"Well, well, it's the little lady of House Ordelia.
What can I do for you?",
32138,SUPPORT,"You piqued my interest when you spoke about my
parents coming to your rescue.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Ah, right. Forgot I let that slip.",
32138,SUPPORT,"After I fled my home, I became something of a
vagrant. Getting into fights, borrowing money
I couldn't pay back, the works.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Oh, I know all about it. You were quite the
vagabond.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Wherever I went, I was treated like trash. Securing
enough food to live on got harder and harder.",
32138,SUPPORT,"It became clear that I wasn't welcome in Alliance
territory, so I decided to head over to the Empire.",
32138,SUPPORT,"My big mistake was stopping by the Great Bridge of
Myrddin on the way.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Just my luck, some jerk of a minor lord north of
the bridge was on a hunt for the bounty on my head.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Oh, that's awful...",
32138,SUPPORT,"Would have been fine if I'd been alone, but innocent
folks were around. Didn't want to endanger them.",
32138,SUPPORT,"That's when I turned tail. I ran until I couldn't run
another step, and found myself in Ordelia territory.",
32138,SUPPORT,"I knew Count Ordelia from when I was still with my
family's house, so it seemed like a decent option.",
32138,SUPPORT,"I was hoping our history would be enough to secure
a place of sanctuary...but no such luck.",
32138,SUPPORT,They refused to take you in?,
32138,SUPPORT,"Yeah. I could tell there was some reason behind it,
but they told me to get out as fast as I could.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Ah... I imagine it was when the Empire was meddling
with my family. We lived in shackles back then.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Makes sense. Still, I'm grateful. They gave me food
and distracted the Empire's cronies so I could escape.",
32138,SUPPORT,"I was half dead from starvation, so that meal saved
my life—no joke. Your family's the real deal.",
32138,SUPPORT,"Just imagine what the Empire would have done to
me. I can tell you it wouldn't have been pretty.",
32138,SUPPORT,"I have no doubts. We weren't allowed contact with
anyone from the outside. It was strictly forbidden.",
32138,SUPPORT,"I see. Well, that's when I vowed to find a way to
repay them. One day, I'll do just that.",
32138,SUPPORT,"And when do you intend to carry out this vow
of yours?",
32138,SUPPORT,"In due honesty, I don't see you as someone capable
of carrying out vows right now. Or even keeping
your things together...",
32138,SUPPORT,"Haha! Can't argue with that. It'll take me a while to
repay that debt, but I will. Just you wait and see.",
32139,SUPPORT,"Little Lysithea! These ears miss nothing, you know.",
32139,SUPPORT,What are you on about this time?,
32139,SUPPORT,"Is it true that Count Ordelia plans to relinquish
his title eventually?",
32139,SUPPORT,Yes. But why are you asking?,
32139,SUPPORT,"I approve, that's all. Throwing off the shackles of
nobility to live freely. It's a beautiful thing.",
32139,SUPPORT,"I would ask that you refrain from painting them with
the same brushstrokes that you so liberally paint
yourself with.",
32139,SUPPORT,"My mother and father will carry on with all the
associated duties befitting of nobles. Only after that
will they retire.",
32139,SUPPORT,"Got it. And that's completely different from someone
like me who tapped out of the nobility game, right?",
32139,SUPPORT,"Your parents are exemplary nobles, that's for sure.
I respect that you support them as much as you do.",
32139,SUPPORT,Would you just stop. You're embarrassing me.,
32139,SUPPORT,"Can't be helped. Meant every word. If anyone should
have red cheeks, it's me, given the choices I've made.",
32139,SUPPORT,I'm sure you had your reasons.,
32139,SUPPORT,"Of course. Still, it is a bit cowardly of me not to
stand up to my family a bit more.",
32139,SUPPORT,"Honestly... It's since getting to know you that I've
started thinking along those lines.",
32139,SUPPORT,"One day soon, I'll return to that house. My reception
will be chilly at best... Still, it must be done.",
32139,SUPPORT,"My house is full of lowlifes. But it also has my little
bro, who took over when I left. He's good people.",
32139,SUPPORT,"Even with the difficulties in Leicester, our house
is still going strong. That's his doing.",
32139,SUPPORT,"That's why I've decided that it's time to talk to him
about what can be done to help Count Ordelia.",
32139,SUPPORT,"Repaying your perceived debt would be nice, sure,
but it sounds like you intend to foist your
responsibility on to your little brother.",
32139,SUPPORT,"Ah, but the two aren't related. This is just the right
thing to do. I'm still pondering how best to fulfill
my vow.",
32139,SUPPORT,Uh-huh...,
32139,SUPPORT,"Wow. You don't believe me, do you, little lady?",
32139,SUPPORT,"Just what exactly are you planning on in terms of
this...repayment?",
32139,SUPPORT,"After your family relinquishes their noble titles,
I'll support them so that you can all live in peace.",
32139,SUPPORT,Even though you're a lowlife?,
32139,SUPPORT,"That may be true—and it is—but consider this. I've
seen life from both sides. As a noble and a vagabond.",
32139,SUPPORT,"When their situation changes, they'll face new
challenges. I'm the perfect guy to help 'em through.",
32139,SUPPORT,"You're irresponsible and unreliable, but clearly,
you're not a bad person.",
32139,SUPPORT,And your support would be most appreciated.,
32139,SUPPORT,"Just so you're aware, however, we have no means
with which to pay you. So are you sure you're still
willing to follow through with this?",
32139,SUPPORT,"I wasn't planning on doing this for a payout. But if
you really insisted on a thank-you gift...",
32139,SUPPORT,"Well, you could always accept me into your family.
Then paying me wouldn't be a consideration.",
32139,SUPPORT,Excuse me? Just what are you insinuating?,
32139,SUPPORT,"Don't think too hard about it just yet. I still have lots
of debts to pay and affairs to settle. In the meantime,
let's just stick close together, yeah?",
32140,SUPPORT,"Mmf, Corcor. Hoff're roo?",
32140,SUPPORT,Hapi? What in the world has gotten into you?,
32140,SUPPORT,Nmf neb ter buh jealouf. Thurf plenny ter go aroud.,
32140,SUPPORT,"Hapi, it would be easier to understand you if your
mouth was less stuffed.",
32140,SUPPORT,"Kindly finish what you are eating and then say
your piece.",
32140,SUPPORT,Ma pleffer!,
32140,SUPPORT,"Nothing better than fresh pastries. You sure you
don't want one, Coco?",
32140,SUPPORT,"It's not about whether I want a bun or not. It's about
your atrocious manners!",
32140,SUPPORT,"Walking around with your arms and jaws stuffed
full of unwrapped pastries...",
32140,SUPPORT,"There are crumbs all over your lips, your clothes—
You've left a trail of them behind you! Unacceptable!",
32140,SUPPORT,"Hey, I paid for them. I can eat them however I want.",
32140,SUPPORT,"You sure you don't want a bite? If you don't have
any, I'm just gonna eat 'em all.",
32140,SUPPORT,"You have to try them fresh out of the oven if you
want the full effect. Pretty soon they'll get cold.",
32140,SUPPORT,"Oh, I'll explain in noble-speak so you understand.
Ehem. They have a crisp, oven-browned exterior,
and a sophisticated, spongy sweetness lying within!",
32140,SUPPORT,"Uh, not—",
32140,SUPPORT,Not interested? That's fine. More for me.,
32140,SUPPORT,"I was going to say, ""Not so fast!"" Spare one for me,
but only because you insisted.",
32140,SUPPORT,"It would be rude of me to decline an offering made
in good faith. One must mind one's manners.",
32140,SUPPORT,"You're really dragging this out. Here, I'll make it
easy for you. Open up...",
32140,SUPPORT,"Wait, don't you—",
32140,SUPPORT,"Not bad, right?",
32140,SUPPORT,"I could not, in good conscience, acknowledge this
as anything but delicious.",
32140,SUPPORT,Now you have crumbs all over you too.,
32140,SUPPORT,"Your form could use a little work. Next time,
stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once.",
32140,SUPPORT,That's the proper way to eat a snack like this.,
32140,SUPPORT,"If you ate this at some stuffy party, cutting it into
sensible little bites, the experience would be ruined.",
32140,SUPPORT,"I see your point. There are more types of dining in
this world than I was ready to allow for.",
32140,SUPPORT,You've won me over.,
32140,SUPPORT,"Let's eat them while we head to the cathedral,
and litter the ground with crumbs.",
32140,SUPPORT,A capital idea— Wait! No!,
32140,SUPPORT,"Not the cathedral! You've lost me again, Hapi!",
32141,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! Thank you for going to such lengths to
come see me, Hapi.",
32141,SUPPORT,"I live here, so it's not like I had to travel a long way.
Do you need me for something, Coco?",
32141,SUPPORT,"""Need"" might be an exaggeration...",
32141,SUPPORT,"Good, because I was just headed to bed. It's nearly
sunset. Have a good night.",
32141,SUPPORT,"Wait, no! Just because I don't need you for anything
doesn't mean you may go.",
32141,SUPPORT,"""Need"" isn't quite it precisely. Hmm, how to broach
the subject nicely?",
32141,SUPPORT,Nice rhyme. Are you dabbling in poetry now?,
32141,SUPPORT,"Don't be daft! Anyway, I need you for something.",
32141,SUPPORT,You could have just said that from the start.,
32141,SUPPORT,So you want me to drink...whatever this is.,
32141,SUPPORT,"It's how I intend to show my gratitude for all the
things you do for me.",
32141,SUPPORT,"Right, right, everything I do for you, such as...
Uh, what, exactly?",
32141,SUPPORT,"You know. The pastries... The dried meats... Sharing
your fruits...",
32141,SUPPORT,"Oh, like when we ate those currants and you got
juice all over your face!",
32141,SUPPORT,"Must you bring that up every time?! It took me
hours to get the stains out of my favorite fan.",
32141,SUPPORT,"I thought it was funny. So...what's this drink you
gave me? It smells good, but it looks weird.",
32141,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! It's all the rage amongst the elite now.
They call it coffee.",
32141,SUPPORT,"It's derived from rare Dagdan beans, which are
roasted, ground, and then boiled over water.",
32141,SUPPORT,"That's a lot of effort to make hot bean-water.
Nobles find such inventive ways to waste time.",
32141,SUPPORT,Hold your criticism until you've tasted it.,
32141,SUPPORT,"And taste it quickly, please. This is a beverage that
one must drink hot.",
32141,SUPPORT,"All right, I guess.",
32141,SUPPORT,Well? Your verdict?,
32141,SUPPORT,Whoa. This is not what I expected.,
32141,SUPPORT,"It kind of tastes like mud, but also, it's delicious and
I never want to stop drinking it.",
32141,SUPPORT,"Exactly my reaction! The flavor is so striking that
one trembles for more!",
32141,SUPPORT,All gone. Got more?,
32141,SUPPORT,Ahaha! Indeed I do not!,
32141,SUPPORT,"The coffee bean, as I mentioned, is rare and thus
expensive. They are not easy to procure.",
32141,SUPPORT,"Though, if I could restore House Nuvelle to its
former glory, I might have means to acquire more.",
32141,SUPPORT,"On second thought, never mind. You don't have to
go to all that trouble.",
32141,SUPPORT,"Oh, but I was going to restore my house anyway.
It just may be...some time until my finances improve.",
32141,SUPPORT,"How about we go to the woods and find some fruit
trees, like we did the other day?",
32141,SUPPORT,"Fresh fruit might not be as fancy as coffee, but it's
good enough for me. Come on.",
32141,SUPPORT,"If that's all you desire, I think I can indulge you.",
32141,SUPPORT,To the orchards!,
32142,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! Delicious, is it not?",
32142,SUPPORT,"There is little that can rival the taste of a freshly
caught fish grilled to perfection over an open flame.",
32142,SUPPORT,I prefer mine with a pinch of salt.,
32142,SUPPORT,"Heh. Look at you, eating regular food like the rest of
us regular folk.",
32142,SUPPORT,"It's only temporary. A fish from the river is a coin
saved at the marketplace. My project will require
every bit of gold I can spare.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Plus, there's a war going on. We've all got to save
money however we can.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Constance, what is that shabby meal you're eating
with such lowly company?",
32142,SUPPORT,"I suppose, after all that's happened, she's given up on
regaining her noble title. Probably for the best.",
32142,SUPPORT,How dare you!,
32142,SUPPORT,"Would you two mind your own business?
We're just trying to eat in peace.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Did you hear that? It sounds like a stray cat
is screeching at us.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Oh dear, she's not using any silverware to speak of.
She's just eating with her paws.",
32142,SUPPORT,"I'd expect that from a commoner, but Constance
seems to be doing the same thing. How humiliating.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Ohoho! We're so vicious, beating up on poor,
pathetic Constance after all of her setbacks.",
32142,SUPPORT,Ahahaha!,
32142,SUPPORT,What are you laughing at?,
32142,SUPPORT,"Pardon my outburst, but I couldn't help myself
after your ridiculous conversation.",
32142,SUPPORT,"How I eat my fish has nothing to do with my status.
In fact, I shall vow one thing now.",
32142,SUPPORT,"When House Nuvelle is restored, I shall bite into
a whole fish thrice weekly!",
32142,SUPPORT,Pardon?,
32142,SUPPORT,"Moreover, Hapi is a dear friend. I won't permit you
to call her a ""stray cat"" or anything so insulting.",
32142,SUPPORT,"We shall continue to remain steadfast friends, even
after my title is restored!",
32142,SUPPORT,And how soon do you expect that to happen?,
32142,SUPPORT,"We both know that if she carries on with such
disgraceful behavior, she won't restore her house
any time soon.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Well! For the upper class, those two seemed
rather classless.",
32142,SUPPORT,Um... What just happened?,
32142,SUPPORT,"Oh, I knew them of old. They were callow
noblewomen from the school of sorcery.",
32142,SUPPORT,"No, I mean...you said that I'm a dear friend. Did you
really mean that?",
32142,SUPPORT,"Hm? Oh, one says all sorts of things when one feels
like being cruel. But, yes, I really meant that.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Even when I am a noble once more, I expect you to
keep me company well into my dotage.",
32142,SUPPORT,"Of course, Coco. Won't be easy getting rid of me.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Ahahaha! Tremble with wonder at the magnificence
of my sorcery!",
32143,SUPPORT,"Unbelievable! It's simple tea, but somehow it's
shining with the colors of the rainbow!",
32143,SUPPORT,"And the color's changing as it's being poured!
How magical!",
32143,SUPPORT,"Of course it's magical—I achieved it through magic!
It's a spell of my own design, in fact. Impressed?",
32143,SUPPORT,"Is this what you wished to show me? I must admit
I've never seen such a thing. Is it still potable?",
32143,SUPPORT,"""Is it still potable?"" she asks.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Then I suppose you wouldn't mind taking the
first sip.",
32143,SUPPORT,"That was amusing, Constance, but out with it.
What was that favor you wished to ask of me?",
32143,SUPPORT,It's a small thing regarding my house.,
32143,SUPPORT,"I thought Your Highness might bend some slight
effort toward seeing it restored from nothing.",
32143,SUPPORT,"I had a feeling that was it. I wish I could help, but
you must understand my present circumstances...",
32143,SUPPORT,"Yes, yes, I'm aware. All the more reason for you to
get in on the ground floor, as it were.",
32143,SUPPORT,"My magical might is unrivaled, as I proved to you
only moments ago.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Surely you can see the obvious benefit in having the
sorcerous prodigy Constance at your beck and call.",
32143,SUPPORT,"I agree that you are remarkable. That is
beyond question.",
32143,SUPPORT,"But how do you imagine rainbow tea will help me
to achieve my aim?",
32143,SUPPORT,"Uh, well... Uh... Just imagine the acclaim it will
bring you at tea parties!",
32143,SUPPORT,"It's a most worthy party trick, yes. But I have no use
for such a thing.",
32143,SUPPORT,"W-well, it's not as if that's the only trick up my
sleeve. That was merely a sample of my repertoire.",
32143,SUPPORT,"I never cease my work in developing new magic.
Your Highness is sure to find some of it useful.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Constance... There's something important that I
would like to talk with you about.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Oh? Have we not been discussing weighty matters
all this time?",
32143,SUPPORT,"It's regarding a truth that you and countless
generations of House Nuvelle have occulted.",
32143,SUPPORT,Ah... That.,
32143,SUPPORT,"If you ever feel like revealing all to me, I'd be happy
to talk further.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Until then... My apologies, but as the Imperial
princess, there's nothing I can do to help your cause.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Please don't misunderstand. As your ally and friend,
I'm happy to keep you company.",
32143,SUPPORT,"However, you mustn't expect more from me than
friendship or battle support.",
32143,SUPPORT,"Of course. And now, I shall make myself scarce.
Good day!",
32144,SUPPORT,"You've got a look of resolve on your face, Constance.
Have you come to a decision?",
32144,SUPPORT,"Quite so. I never waver for long, you know.",
32144,SUPPORT,"I can read the signs as well as anyone. Things are in
flux. I mustn't remain shackled by the past.",
32144,SUPPORT,"You have risen to become emperor in this age of
uncertainty. I, too, must adapt to the times.",
32144,SUPPORT,"I am ready to enlighten you regarding the secret that
House Nuvelle has kept for generations.",
32144,SUPPORT,"You have my gratitude. You will be rewarded for
taking such a drastic measure.",
32144,SUPPORT,"To be clear, this is about your Crest, correct?",
32144,SUPPORT,Your instincts are sharp.,
32144,SUPPORT,"According to the Empire's records, I bear the
Major Crest of Macuil.",
32144,SUPPORT,"But those records are mistaken. In point of fact, the
Crest that I bear is—",
32144,SUPPORT,"The Major Crest of Noa, one of the lost saints.",
32144,SUPPORT,"That bloodline was believed to have died out. No
one, not even the Imperial nobility, bears that Crest.",
32144,SUPPORT,"How, then, did you come by that bloodline?
And how did you manage to thwart the Empire's
investigations into the matter?",
32144,SUPPORT,"All of the answers you seek are tied to House
Nuvelle's origins.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Close to a thousand years ago, Saint Noa parted
ways with Saint Seiros. She lived out her days in
seclusion on what would become Nuvelle territory.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Her children obscured their origins before
serving the Empire. It wasn't long before they
were ennobled.",
32144,SUPPORT,"I suspect Saint Noa feared that revealing her Crest
would only lead to tragedy.",
32144,SUPPORT,"So she passed it off as the Crest of Macuil, which
already existed within the Empire...",
32144,SUPPORT,"Yes. Much like Saint Macuil, Saint Noa was known
to be a masterful mage.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Her magic ensured that any test would not reveal
the true nature of her Crest. Otherwise, someone
may have exploited our bloodline long ago.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Hmm... House Nuvelle was known for producing as
few heirs as possible.",
32144,SUPPORT,"It was also known for keeping its offspring ""pure,""
mostly by disallowing marriage with other houses.",
32144,SUPPORT,"All of that effort was in order to conceal Noa's
bloodline, wasn't it?",
32144,SUPPORT,"Yes, but it was a factor in our house's ultimate
downfall.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Our priorities were, perhaps, not what they ought
to have been.",
32144,SUPPORT,"In sidestepping the internal strife within the Empire,
we left ourselves open to the external threat posed
by Dagda.",
32144,SUPPORT,"With stronger blood ties to other houses, we might
have had allies in our time of greatest need.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Interesting... I always had the inkling that the six
noble houses were eager to see House Nuvelle fall.",
32144,SUPPORT,"Thank you for trusting me with this, Constance.",
32144,SUPPORT,"I swear that once I ascend the throne, I will do all
I can to help you revive your fallen house.",
32144,SUPPORT,"As emperor, I swear to do all I can to help you revive
your fallen house.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Your Majesty, might I have a moment of your time?",
32145,SUPPORT,"Yes, of course.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Unless... You're not planning yet another magical
exhibition, are you? Knowing you, it seems a safe bet.",
32145,SUPPORT,"I can't imagine what else it could be. I already
promised to help you revive House Nuvelle.",
32145,SUPPORT,"If our campaign continues as it has, we'll soon
prevail. There's no need to keep inventing spells.",
32145,SUPPORT,"I don't doubt that Your Majesty has things well in
hand when it comes to the war.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Yet why should I allow that to deter me from
achieving my ultimate satisfaction?",
32145,SUPPORT,"As the scion of proud House Nuvelle, I shall bring
about my grand achievement before my house is
restored—on that you may rely!",
32145,SUPPORT,"You have a strong will and a strong mind. You do
not consider yourself above concerted effort either.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Even during wartime, you trust your own ability to
fight and survive. You're ever focused on the future
and on the actions necessary to realize it.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Where is this coming from? If there's an angle to be
played with this praise, it eludes me.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Haha, I was only speaking the truth. I find your
efforts to be admirable.",
32145,SUPPORT,Hmm. Your words are sweet. And yet...,
32145,SUPPORT,"Yes? Please, go on.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Forgive me, Your Majesty, but you promised that
House Nuvelle would be restored.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Yet you work toward a future with no place for the
noble houses of old.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Granted, in your unified Fódlan, the acting lord
for each territory will come from noble stock.",
32145,SUPPORT,"But in the long term, your system will replace the
nobility. Our role will change significantly.",
32145,SUPPORT,"That's exactly right. There will no longer be lords
who inherently rule over a particular territory.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Instead, nobles will act as government officials,
working for the people in exchange for a salary.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Officials will be selected from the general populace
as well, bringing an end to the very concept of social
standing. All will rise and fall by their own merits.",
32145,SUPPORT,"And it is for those reasons that I continue my
magical research.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Even if nobility ceases to exist as a concept, the
meritorious spellcraft displayed by House Nuvelle
shall make us a household name!",
32145,SUPPORT,"Hm. I must admit, your words strike a chord.
I find myself oddly moved by your proclamation.",
32145,SUPPORT,"So you see, Your Majesty, the fortunes of my house
dovetail nicely with your plans.",
32145,SUPPORT,"The road on which you stride courageously forward
leads to my own bright future.",
32145,SUPPORT,"I, too, believe that the future you wish for can be
found at the end of this path we're cutting.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Splendid! Oh! Amid all this talk, I neglected to
present my demonstration.",
32145,SUPPORT,"Sit back as I, Constance von Nuvelle, display the
never-duplicated Nuvelle style of spellcraft!",
32145,SUPPORT,"Ah, about that... Another time, yes? I have much
to do. Elsewhere.",
32145,SUPPORT,"No, wait! There's no time like the present! Why,
it shan't take more than an hour or two!",
32146,SUPPORT,"Life is a series of peaks and valleys. Our reunion is,
to my mind, the highest of peaks.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Spoken like one who's never known the lowest
of valleys.",
32146,SUPPORT,"To think, we were once a pair of blooms, flourishing
side by side in the upper echelons of Enbarr society.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Despite our differing aspirations, I think together we
could have taken the mantle of leading the Empire.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Tread carefully, Ferdinand.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Some part of me clung to hope that you might
emerge from the wreckage. I am glad you have.",
32146,SUPPORT,...,
32146,SUPPORT,I know that was a difficult time for you.,
32146,SUPPORT,"Oh, so you surmised that the single-most-humiliating
event of my life was ""difficult,"" did you?",
32146,SUPPORT,"It is becoming clear to me that this conversation is a
waste of my time.",
32146,SUPPORT,Oh! That was rather brusque.,
32146,SUPPORT,"Well, pardon me if I seem unmannerly in the face of
a reminder of all I have lost.",
32146,SUPPORT,"My family, my home, my friends, my people,
everything. I am all that remains.",
32146,SUPPORT,I... I...,
32146,SUPPORT,"I did not intend to offend you, Constance.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Then what did you intend? How like the ""noblest of
nobles"" to be unaware of the suffering one causes.",
32146,SUPPORT,"You can't grasp what it is to be a newly minted
peasant, can you?",
32146,SUPPORT,"That is simply not true. I care about you, and I was
attempting to offer some words of comfort.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Enough. I need more than words—more than you
have offered to provide.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Though I am without status now, my spirit is no
less noble.",
32146,SUPPORT,"It will not do for you to condescend to me in my
houseless state.",
32146,SUPPORT,"You have my sincerest apologies. That was a grave
misstep.",
32146,SUPPORT,"I did not mean to come across as condescending.
I was merely being careless with my words.",
32146,SUPPORT,"As you say, I have never experienced loss at such a
staggering magnitude.",
32146,SUPPORT,I cannot imagine the pain you have endured.,
32146,SUPPORT,"Indeed, you cannot. I advise against trying.",
32146,SUPPORT,"The more you harp on it, the more irritated with
you I become.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Never shall a day pass that I don't work toward
restoring my house and reclaiming my title.",
32146,SUPPORT,"You, on the other hand, seem content to remind me
that it is lost. Thank you, but I had not forgotten.",
32146,SUPPORT,"Constance, please!",
32146,SUPPORT,"I see no trace of the boy who made waves with me
at balls and embodied the finest in the nobility.",
32146,SUPPORT,"This newfound arrogance of yours is a discredit to
House Aegir.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Hello, Constance.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Greetings, Ferdinand. My condolences on your
misfortune that our paths have crossed again.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Oh dear. I am not used to hearing you deprecate
yourself like that. Never mind, just listen.",
32147,SUPPORT,"If it is an audience you require, I will endeavor to
meet that need.",
32147,SUPPORT,"When we last spoke, I was attempting to connect
with you, to listen and show you some empathy.",
32147,SUPPORT,"But I was so clumsy with my words that I came
across as callous and conceited. I hurt you, I know.",
32147,SUPPORT,"The notion that a noble of House Aegir could
display arrogance is difficult to credit.",
32147,SUPPORT,"That you even deign to speak to me is a testament
to your humility.",
32147,SUPPORT,"As grateful as I am for the honor, it would be best
for us both if I take my leave.",
32147,SUPPORT,"No. Please, hear me out.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Though your words chafed, I see now that they were
perceptive. I was being arrogant.",
32147,SUPPORT,"I tend to...overcompensate. Perhaps I make a fool of
myself, bragging about my superiority to Edelgard.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Now, with my father's fall from grace, I have been
dropped to my knees, utterly humbled.",
32147,SUPPORT,"My house is in shambles. I have nothing. I do not
even know my father's whereabouts.",
32147,SUPPORT,"My house is in shambles. My father is dead. I have
nothing...and no one.",
32147,SUPPORT,"You do yourself a disservice! If you are a fool,
then I am Folly herself.",
32147,SUPPORT,I have heard and grieved for your predicament.,
32147,SUPPORT,"But you must know that it is no reflection on your
sterling quality, Ferdinand.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Even in the face of such adversity, you never strayed
from the correct path.",
32147,SUPPORT,"If this was the right path, the wrong path hardly
bears thinking about.",
32147,SUPPORT,"Still, your kindness has eased my worries a bit.",
32147,SUPPORT,"A wise noble once said that ""life is a series of peaks
and valleys."" But I have struggled to find the peaks.",
32147,SUPPORT,"I was once pushed to the nadir of a valley and have
spent my days confined there ever since.",
32147,SUPPORT,"There is little chance that I will ever return to the
heights I once knew.",
32147,SUPPORT,But it will not be for lack of trying.,
32147,SUPPORT,Your persistence is admirable.,
32147,SUPPORT,"You are too gracious. I see the highest of peaks on
your own road.",
32147,SUPPORT,"The way is steep, but not long. You will reach it yet.",
32147,SUPPORT,"And if my words might reach the ears of a man who
has attained such heights...",
32147,SUPPORT,"Perhaps one who has reached his summit might pull
a climber up behind him?",
32147,SUPPORT,"Such is my heart's desire, unspeakable though it
may be.",
32147,SUPPORT,...,
32148,SUPPORT,Ahaha! You there!,
32148,SUPPORT,"Ah! Is there something I can do for you, Constance?",
32148,SUPPORT,Is there something you can do?! Of course there is!,
32148,SUPPORT,"Well, what is it?",
32148,SUPPORT,It ought to be plain.,
32148,SUPPORT,I...do not follow. Please clarify what you mean.,
32148,SUPPORT,"Have you forgotten the day I revealed to you my
silly little dream?",
32148,SUPPORT,"If you weren't paying attention, I shall be cross.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Oh, yes... You must be referring to the oblique
request you made concerning peaks and valleys.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Not seeing a peak ahead of you, you hoped I might
help lift you out of your lowly sta—",
32148,SUPPORT,Precisely! You've summed it up completely.,
32148,SUPPORT,"Now that you know of what I speak, I want you to
forget it immediately. Act as if you heard nothing.",
32148,SUPPORT,"You want me to forget the occasion you just asked
me to remember. I see.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Before I discard this memory entirely, might I be so
bold as to ask...why?",
32148,SUPPORT,"Is it not obvious? I don't want my weakness
bandied about.",
32148,SUPPORT,"I vowed to restore House Nuvelle through my own
grand achievement.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Just as I would not abandon this dream, I would
not accept it being handed to me.",
32148,SUPPORT,Though if I am to be quite honest...,
32148,SUPPORT,"The real reason is that letting you in on this
vulnerability was an indiscretion I won't repeat.",
32148,SUPPORT,I see. What a curious situation.,
32148,SUPPORT,I don't take your meaning.,
32148,SUPPORT,"Five years ago, with the cladding of my highborn
status stripped away, I was vulnerable and exposed.",
32148,SUPPORT,"The hand of fate stripped everything from me,
leaving me vulnerable and exposed.",
32148,SUPPORT,"To borrow your words...I was in a valley and a thick
shroud of fog obscured the peak before me.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Now the cloud has lifted a bit, and I can see a
glimpse of what lies ahead.",
32148,SUPPORT,"And what, dare I ask, do you see?",
32148,SUPPORT,"There is a towering cliff for you to scale...and a long,
rocky path lying ahead of me.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Rather than ascending separately, we can join hands
and face these obstacles together.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Then we can reach the heights of our forebears—
or, dare I say, even higher.",
32148,SUPPORT,"Even higher, you say?",
32148,SUPPORT,"Now you remind me once more of the boy I knew.
I have but one concern.",
32148,SUPPORT,And what might that be?,
32148,SUPPORT,That I shall outpace your laggardly efforts.,
32148,SUPPORT,"Huh? I was being sincere, you know!",
32148,SUPPORT,Ahahaha!,
32149,SUPPORT,"Am I in bed dreaming, or is that you, Mercedes?
How serendipitous it is to see you again!",
32149,SUPPORT,"Yes, and here we are! You were so small when I saw
you last. How you've grown.",
32149,SUPPORT,"I cannot express how worried I was to hear that you
had left House Bartels.",
32149,SUPPORT,"I was turned away any time I asked about you, and of
course Emile would never tell me anything.",
32149,SUPPORT,"I'm sorry. There was so much going on in House
Bartels back then...",
32149,SUPPORT,"But enough about all that. How are you, Constance?
I hear you've had hardships of your own.",
32149,SUPPORT,"Indeed. House Nuvelle is no more, and I went alone
to the school of sorcery.",
32149,SUPPORT,Oh! You went to the Royal School of Sorcery?,
32149,SUPPORT,"Just before I began at the Officers Academy, I was
studying there as well.",
32149,SUPPORT,"You were?! It must have been after my graduation
in 1177...",
32149,SUPPORT,"That was the year I enrolled. We probably just
missed each other.",
32149,SUPPORT,"No! You mean to say that if I had stayed a trifle
longer, we could have been reunited sooner?",
32149,SUPPORT,"It seems so. Haha! Ah, dear Constance. When we
were little, I thought of you as my little sister.",
32149,SUPPORT,"But now that you've grown up, I think our roles
might be reversed! I'll be looking up to you now,
and maybe even asking for your help sometimes.",
32149,SUPPORT,"You'd ask for my help? I never thought I'd see
the day!",
32149,SUPPORT,"And yet you are seeing it. You know, I had another
friend at the school. Her name is Annie.",
32149,SUPPORT,"Why don't we all have some tea together? I'm sure
you two would really hit it off.",
32149,SUPPORT,"You must mean Annette. Yes, I would welcome the
chance to have a long chat with her.",
32149,SUPPORT,"Haha! Oh, I have an idea! How about we have a
cup of tea together and chat about old times?",
32149,SUPPORT,"I accept, naturally!",
32149,SUPPORT,I'll prepare the tea straightaway.,
32149,SUPPORT,"Oh, no need to rush! The tea isn't going anywhere.",
32149,SUPPORT,"Don't be ridiculous! Time is always of the essence.
Why put off for later what I... I could...",
32149,SUPPORT,Constance? I wonder what's the matter.,
32149,SUPPORT,Did something happen?,
32149,SUPPORT,"Mercedes...sharing your precious time with me is
perhaps more than I deserve.",
32149,SUPPORT,What do you mean?,
32149,SUPPORT,"Why sit with me when you could share your teatime
with someone else?",
32149,SUPPORT,"I shall instead stand and serve the tea. Though if my
presence still proves to be a burden...",
32149,SUPPORT,"Goodness, of course it isn't! Are you feeling all right?",
32149,SUPPORT,"My feelings are immaterial. Pardon me while I fetch
the tea leaves at once.",
32149,SUPPORT,"Until a moment ago, everything seemed all right.
Why did she change so suddenly?",
32149,SUPPORT,I'll have to ask her what's going on.,
32150,SUPPORT,"I see. The sunlight brings back painful memories
in you.",
32150,SUPPORT,"I'm afraid so. Please forgive my behavior from before.
I cannot abide these indiscretions of mine.",
32150,SUPPORT,"That's all right. The way you always work so hard
day and night, it's no wonder it's had this effect
on you.",
32150,SUPPORT,"You work harder than anyone I know. I've always
been impressed by that, Constance.",
32150,SUPPORT,That means a lot to me.,
32150,SUPPORT,"You know, at the school of sorcery there was a
professor who specialized in magical cures.",
32150,SUPPORT,"Why not write her a letter? Perhaps she can suggest
a treatment that might help.",
32150,SUPPORT,I have tried. She could do nothing for me.,
32150,SUPPORT,"But I vowed then to the goddess that I would find a
way to overcome my trials.",
32150,SUPPORT,"I will prove my skills to the goddess and everyone
else, bringing me closer to restoring House Nuvelle!",
32150,SUPPORT,"Haha! You're a tough cookie, Constance!",
32150,SUPPORT,"Naturally. And with your support, I shall grow ever
stronger by the day!",
32150,SUPPORT,"I know you will! You know...during the years of
political turmoil, House Martritz was destroyed
just as your house was.",
32150,SUPPORT,"But restoring my father's house has hardly crossed
my mind. I guess I'm not as tenacious as you are.",
32150,SUPPORT,"You needn't be so hard on yourself, Mercedes.
You have had other priorities since then.",
32150,SUPPORT,Oh! I've just had a grand idea!,
32150,SUPPORT,What is it?,
32150,SUPPORT,You ought to try to reinstate House Martritz!,
32150,SUPPORT,Oh dear! I'm not sure that's possible.,
32150,SUPPORT,"Nonsense. If I can restore my own house, then you
can restore yours.",
32150,SUPPORT,"As we work to further our own like goals, we shall
learn so much that we can share with one another!",
32150,SUPPORT,"You make it sound so simple. How would I even go
about that?",
32150,SUPPORT,"That is simplicity itself! You shall become a prodigy
at spellcraft, as I am.",
32150,SUPPORT,"Um, all right.",
32150,SUPPORT,"I shall master the black arts, and you shall master the
white. The world will know us as sister sages!",
32150,SUPPORT,I see...,
32150,SUPPORT,"Our names shall ring out across Fódlan, earning us
the titles we rightly deserve!",
32150,SUPPORT,"I hope you won't mind me saying so, but this plan
seems to have gotten a bit far-fetched.",
32150,SUPPORT,"Oh, no, not if you join me, Mercedes! Where one
may fail, together we are bound to succeed!",
32150,SUPPORT,"She has such big plans...perhaps too big. In that way
at least, she's exactly the same as when she was little.",
32151,SUPPORT,"Ugh, what's the use? Even with all I've learned, I still
don't understand!",
32151,SUPPORT,"Hello, Constance. I hope I'm not interrupting.",
32151,SUPPORT,Not at all. I was just in need of a sympathetic ear.,
32151,SUPPORT,"I found a magical scroll, which, unless I am mistaken,
should relieve me of my woes.",
32151,SUPPORT,"Oh, wonderful!",
32151,SUPPORT,"Not so fast. The magic within this scroll is a type I
have neglected to study.",
32151,SUPPORT,"It pains me to admit this, but it may take decades
of going back to the basics to grasp it.",
32151,SUPPORT,"Decades? That's a long time to spend with your nose
buried in an old piece of parchment.",
32151,SUPPORT,"Why must the goddess dangle a solution before me,
only to cruelly pull it away?",
32151,SUPPORT,"There's no need to despair. To tell the truth, I like
you just as you are.",
32151,SUPPORT,You do?,
32151,SUPPORT,"Why? Those low moods of mine have never done
anyone the least bit of good.",
32151,SUPPORT,"You're like a little sister to me. Nothing you do will
change that, not even a little bit.",
32151,SUPPORT,Really?,
32151,SUPPORT,"Of course. You're my sweet Constance, and I like
you just as you are.",
32151,SUPPORT,I...I see.,
32151,SUPPORT,"Perhaps my moods are not the great burden I
thought they were...",
32151,SUPPORT,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you.
No matter what decision you make, I support you.",
32151,SUPPORT,"I felt no pressure, I assure you. It's more that I
feel...embarrassed to have been embarrassed.",
32151,SUPPORT,"I'd put so much effort into finding a magical means
to alleviate myself...",
32151,SUPPORT,"That it never occurred to me that maybe all I needed
was to accept myself.",
32151,SUPPORT,What will you do with the scroll you found?,
32151,SUPPORT,"Oh, I'll continue to research it...for research's sake,
if nothing else. But I may have no need of it.",
32151,SUPPORT,"It's not as if these moods of mine have ever hampered
my efforts to restore my house.",
32151,SUPPORT,"And I am as a sister to you no matter which face
I present, yes?",
32151,SUPPORT,"Nothing—no mood, no foe, no obligation—will keep
me from honoring my sisterly duty to protect you!",
32151,SUPPORT,Haha! We can protect each other.,
32151,SUPPORT,"Good! It is settled! Now we can begin the hard work
of reclaiming our titles.",
32151,SUPPORT,"Absolutely! We'll become sister sages and restore our
houses to their former glory.",
32151,SUPPORT,You understand the plan perfectly!,
32151,SUPPORT,"If we walk this path together...it can only end
in triumph!",
32152,SUPPORT,Hmm...,
32152,SUPPORT,"Hapi, you must know that it's rather uncomfortable
to be the subject of such an unflinching gaze.",
32152,SUPPORT,"You'll have to put up with it for a little while longer.
I feel like I can almost remember...",
32152,SUPPORT,"Apologies, but I'm not sure what you're referring to.
Care to elaborate?",
32152,SUPPORT,"I have this sense that we met somewhere...before we
were students.",
32152,SUPPORT,"But you're the prince of Faerghus, so how could I
have met you?",
32152,SUPPORT,I do not recall meeting you previously either.,
32152,SUPPORT,"Although... Long ago, I sometimes accompanied
my father as he traveled the Kingdom. Perhaps we
crossed paths...",
32152,SUPPORT,"Unlikely. I lived in an isolated village in the forest.
We didn't have contact with outsiders.",
32152,SUPPORT,"After I ran away, I was kidnapped, and my kidnapper
kept me locked up all day and night.",
32152,SUPPORT,"I think I'd remember if the royal family had stopped
by for a visit.",
32152,SUPPORT,Kidnapped? What do you mean by that?,
32152,SUPPORT,"A lady found me, a helpless runaway, and offered to
take me in. She promised to keep me safe.",
32152,SUPPORT,"Instead I became her test subject. She experimented
on me with all kinds of spells and rituals.",
32152,SUPPORT,"I had a roof over my head and plenty to eat.
But otherwise, it was...a pretty bad experience.",
32152,SUPPORT,...,
32152,SUPPORT,"This may be unwelcome from a stranger like myself,
but I want you to know that it's perfectly acceptable
to be angry about such unfortunate circumstances.",
32152,SUPPORT,"I can't fathom why someone would cause you pain
like that. I'm sorry you had to endure such a thing.",
32152,SUPPORT,"You have every right to feel anything you need to
feel toward the person responsible for your suffering.",
32152,SUPPORT,"Oh! That's weird. Hmm, I wonder...",
32152,SUPPORT,What's the matter? Was it something I said?,
32152,SUPPORT,It's just that I've heard those words before.,
32152,SUPPORT,"I think it was someone else who said them, but...
I can't remember who.",
32152,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'll figure it out some day. In the meantime,
see you around.",
32152,SUPPORT,"Yes, of course. If our meeting again can help you in
any way, you need only ask and I'll be there.",
32153,SUPPORT,"I did not expect to see you here, Hapi. I get the
feeling that you didn't come for training.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Listen up, Didi. I remembered something.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Remembered? Ah, does this have something to do
with why you were staring at me earlier?",
32153,SUPPORT,"Not ringing any bells. I stare at people all the time.
Anyway, do you know Anselma?",
32153,SUPPORT,"Anselma... Yes, of course. But how do you know
that name?",
32153,SUPPORT,"That is what my stepmother was called in the
Empire. In the Kingdom, she was called Patricia.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Oh, so that's what it was. I see now. What a relief.",
32153,SUPPORT,"It was really sticking in my craw. Well, now that
that's all settled, I'm off to bed.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Just one moment. You may understand, but I most
certainly do not. How did you know my stepmother?",
32153,SUPPORT,"She used to visit all the time. I think she was friends
with the lady who kidnapped me.",
32153,SUPPORT,Friends? Are you sure?,
32153,SUPPORT,"I heard the lady helped bring her to the Kingdom,
but I don't really know the details.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Anyway, when Anselma saw how I was being treated,
she got angry, just like you.",
32153,SUPPORT,"You remind me a lot of her, actually.",
32153,SUPPORT,Are we really that much alike?,
32153,SUPPORT,"I'd say so. Come to think of it, you greet people in
the same way, hold a book in the same way...",
32153,SUPPORT,You even get angry in the same way! It's uncanny.,
32153,SUPPORT,"I share no blood with my stepmother, but to hear
you say that... It pleases me greatly.",
32153,SUPPORT,"I share no blood with my stepmother, but to hear
you say that... It conjures a great deal of emotion.",
32153,SUPPORT,"She was the one who raised me. I suppose it makes
sense that we would share certain mannerisms.",
32153,SUPPORT,"To think that the person you mentioned was my
stepmother is...baffling, to say the least.",
32153,SUPPORT,What do you mean?,
32153,SUPPORT,"For all intents and purposes, my stepmother was
completely cut off from the outside world.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Suffice it to say few knew that my father had taken a
second wife.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Sounds...complicated. I can keep my mouth shut,
if you like.",
32153,SUPPORT,"I would very much appreciate your silence on the
matter. But thank you, truly, for all that you said.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Don't worry too much about it, Hapi. However,
if you could consent to keeping all of that between
us, I'd be much obliged.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Truth be told, the union between my father and
stepmother has given rise to...much speculation.",
32153,SUPPORT,"But for now, what's truly baffling me is the identity
of that lady you mentioned...",
32153,SUPPORT,"She welcomed my stepmother into the Kingdom
after she fled home due to political strife... Hm.",
32153,SUPPORT,"No, I must stop this. It's time to put an end to this
discussion. Baseless speculation will get me nowhere.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Oh, come on. I finally felt like I understood, and
then you go and say something cryptic like that.",
32153,SUPPORT,"If I can't sleep tonight, I'm blaming you.",
32153,SUPPORT,"Well, if that happens, come back here and I'll keep
you company. I'll be training a while yet.",
32153,SUPPORT,I wonder... Could Hapi's captor truly be her?,
32154,SUPPORT,"Hapi, I must speak with you. I've realized the woman
who held you captive...was Cornelia herself.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Oh. Yeah. Good on you for figuring it out. You're a
little late though, considering she's dead.",
32154,SUPPORT,"How are you feeling about what she said, by the way?
You seemed pretty upset at the time.",
32154,SUPPORT,"It couldn't have been easy to hear all that stuff about
your stepmother and the Tragedy of Duscur.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Whether Cornelia's words prove true or false,
any lead is worth following.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Hm. This might not be related, but I remembered
something else about your stepmother.",
32154,SUPPORT,"She had a daughter. Her daughter was staying in the
Kingdom at one point, but Anselma couldn't see her.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Her daughter... Neither my father nor I knew that
the Imperial princess was in Fhirdiad at the time.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Oh, that's not what I heard. I heard the king wanted
to keep the child away from Anselma.",
32154,SUPPORT,So he hid the fact that their daughter was nearby.,
32154,SUPPORT,"She believed that Father hid it from her? What could
he have gained from such a thing?",
32154,SUPPORT,"No clue. Sorry, but I'm the wrong person to ask.",
32154,SUPPORT,"As she was seeking asylum from the Empire in the
Kingdom, Lord Arundel was obligated to hide the
Imperial princess's whereabouts.",
32154,SUPPORT,"If her location had gone public, the Empire would
have demanded her return.",
32154,SUPPORT,"She would undoubtedly have become a political
pawn in the Kingdom as well. The decision to
hide her was not my father's.",
32154,SUPPORT,"I did not realize until much later that the girl I'd met
under such strange circumstances was my stepsister.",
32154,SUPPORT,"So then...why did Anselma think that it was all
your father's doing?",
32154,SUPPORT,"I can only speculate, but it seems there was a
misunderstanding between her and my father.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Although she was the queen consort, in truth,
my father and stepmother were not even allowed
the dignity of being alone together.",
32154,SUPPORT,"And the one who persistently inserted herself
between them was their intermediary...your captor.",
32154,SUPPORT,It was Cornelia herself.,
32154,SUPPORT,She hid it from Anselma.,
32154,SUPPORT,"I believe so. Meanwhile, she may have hidden my
stepmother's presence from Lord Arundel as well.",
32154,SUPPORT,"If Cornelia caused my stepmother to miss out on
seeing them, exhorted her, used her, and then also
caused the Tragedy... Hmm.",
32154,SUPPORT,"I'm surprised she pulled one over on both of them.
She was pretty reckless. But in a way, it makes sense.",
32154,SUPPORT,"She loved causing pain. That's why she used me and
discarded me without a second thought.",
32154,SUPPORT,"I fully agree. Countless people have been subjected
to undue suffering as a result of her behavior.",
32154,SUPPORT,"That is why I would like your help with something,
if that's agreeable to you. You are my only hope.",
32154,SUPPORT,"If you put it like that, I can't exactly say no, can I?",
32154,SUPPORT,I wish to learn all that you know about Cornelia.,
32154,SUPPORT,"If I follow the traces she left behind, perhaps I can
finally learn the truth of the tragedy.",
32154,SUPPORT,"And perhaps I'll also be able to find a way to lift
the curse she placed upon you...",
32154,SUPPORT,Oh. That would be...nice.,
32154,SUPPORT,"The people from the church couldn't figure out a
solution, so I won't get my hopes up.",
32154,SUPPORT,"That is perhaps for the best. That said, I am a
stubborn man who is not often inclined to give up.",
32154,SUPPORT,"I will not allow history to repeat itself. Neither the
tragedy, nor your own personal torments.",
32154,SUPPORT,"If you're going to be so intense about this, I can't
help but get my hopes up.",
32154,SUPPORT,"But it's not always easy having me by your side.
You always need to be on guard.",
32154,SUPPORT,"You have my word. Should a thousand beasts raise
their claws at me, I will happily send them running.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Let's hope it doesn't come to that, Didi.",
32154,SUPPORT,"Heh. Though it might be kinda fun watching you
tear those monsters to shreds.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Thanks so much for the help. We should be able to
manage on our own from here.",
32155,SUPPORT,"I'm glad to be of use. If there's anything else you
need, come find me anytime.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Well, well. You seem to be pretty chummy with
the knights.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Chummy? I suppose... Really I was just helping out
with some equipment repairs.",
32155,SUPPORT,For an assignment or something?,
32155,SUPPORT,"No. It just looked like they could use a hand, so...
I lent one.",
32155,SUPPORT,"To me, it looked like they were using you for some
unpaid labor.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Unpaid labor? Heh heh, I helped them because
I wanted to, Hapi. I wasn't expecting to be paid.",
32155,SUPPORT,"It's like when you help us with our assignments.
We don't pay you for that, do we?",
32155,SUPPORT,"Like I have a choice. Can I give you some advice,
Freckles?",
32155,SUPPORT,"Don't support the knights, the church, any of them.
All you'll get in return is a knife in the back.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Isn't that a little...dramatic? You really don't need to
worry about that with most people...",
32155,SUPPORT,"You're naive. Those two-faced buffoons exasperate
me so much, I can hardly help but—",
32155,SUPPORT,"Oh! Ah... Hey! That reminds me of a great story.
You have to hear this one.",
32155,SUPPORT,"It's called, um... Oh! The Luna Knight's Tale!
Yeah—I think you'll love this!",
32155,SUPPORT,"On second thought, maybe a story about a knight
isn't what you want to hear right now...",
32155,SUPPORT,"You know, the knights in stories aren't like the ones
in real life.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Unless the Luna Knight is a liar who does
terrible things.",
32155,SUPPORT,"No, of course not! The Luna Knight is the hero
of the story.",
32155,SUPPORT,"She's from an offshoot of House Blaiddyd. Marries
into House Riegan after the Crescent Moon War.",
32155,SUPPORT,"In peacetime, she sets aside her weapons and devotes
herself to giving wise counsel to her husband.",
32155,SUPPORT,"In this role, she ensures that the dishonest and
unfaithful are dealt with accordingly.",
32155,SUPPORT,Huh. She sounds like a real hero.,
32155,SUPPORT,"Very much so, yes! The tale is full of fascinating
details about her...",
32155,SUPPORT,"Ashe! Sorry to interrupt, but if you're not too busy,
we could really use your help right now.",
32155,SUPPORT,"Of course! Be right there. I'll tell you the rest of the
tale later. OK, Hapi?",
32155,SUPPORT,"Um... Sure, I guess.",
32155,SUPPORT,"But seriously, watch yourself, OK? I don't want you
to learn I'm right the hard way.",
32155,SUPPORT,"See ya, Freckles. I can hardly wait to hear that
riveting story of yours.",
32155,SUPPORT,Using me... I've never thought about it that way.,
32156,SUPPORT,Hapi! I've been looking everywhere for you.,
32156,SUPPORT,What's going on? Something urgent?,
32156,SUPPORT,"Oh, no. Hehe, but I promised to tell you the rest of
the Luna Knight's Tale, remember?",
32156,SUPPORT,Huh. I'd forgotten all about that.,
32156,SUPPORT,"Huh. That was years ago, wasn't it? You have a
good memory.",
32156,SUPPORT,"If you really want to tell the story that badly, I guess
just...go ahead.",
32156,SUPPORT,"OK, I will! Do you remember where I left off?",
32156,SUPPORT,"Hmm... Well, you were telling me something about
how the Luna Knight was hard on liars and cheaters.",
32156,SUPPORT,"Right! So her husband, Duke Riegan, turns out to be
a bit of a libertine...",
32156,SUPPORT,"Haha, that's hilarious!",
32156,SUPPORT,"My favorite part was when she caught her husband in
the act and tossed him out the window.",
32156,SUPPORT,"I thought tales about knights were supposed to be
straitlaced, but this one's raunchy as heck.",
32156,SUPPORT,"I'm, uh, glad you enjoyed it. Usually these tales
are pretty serious...",
32156,SUPPORT,"But sometimes, in a serious story, you need lighter
moments like that to connect to the characters.",
32156,SUPPORT,"It helps to see that even these great heroes made
mistakes now and again. Just like us.",
32156,SUPPORT,"You're so trusting, Freckles. For some reason,
I find it endearing.",
32156,SUPPORT,"But you shouldn't take something at face value just
because it's written down.",
32156,SUPPORT,"The truth is, knights do plenty of things that aren't
heroic at all. Things that hurt people.",
32156,SUPPORT,You're not wrong. Some knights do terrible things.,
32156,SUPPORT,"That doesn't make the great ones any less worthy of
honor though.",
32156,SUPPORT,"What about knights who have died taking a stand
against the church? Would you call them great?",
32156,SUPPORT,That's...complicated...,
32156,SUPPORT,"Or what about the knights who put me in Abyss,
promising to release me from my curse.",
32156,SUPPORT,"When they couldn't, they left me there out of fear for
what I might do. Does that sound honorable to you?",
32156,SUPPORT,Hapi...I'm so sorry...,
32156,SUPPORT,"Ah, sorry... I can't help but say nasty things.",
32156,SUPPORT,"Got any more stories for me? Maybe another
racy one?",
32156,SUPPORT,"Yes, actually! I came prepared with the most...uh,
racy ones I could find...in case you happened to ask.",
32156,SUPPORT,"Of course you did. Let's hear one, then.",
32157,SUPPORT,"...This is why I keep telling people we need to keep
her underground.",
32157,SUPPORT,"The church records explain in full detail what a
threat she poses to everyone's safety.",
32157,SUPPORT,"It's a miracle that no one was hurt. Next time, we
may not be so lucky.",
32157,SUPPORT,"What makes you so certain this incident was caused
by her sighing?",
32157,SUPPORT,It seems unfair to cast blame until you're truly sure.,
32157,SUPPORT,"Isn't it obvious? A horde of monsters appeared out of
nowhere and attacked us.",
32157,SUPPORT,"Uh-oh. You guys are talking about me, aren't you?",
32157,SUPPORT,"There you are. You won't get away with this crime.
I'll make sure everyone knows who was to blame.",
32157,SUPPORT,Hey! You didn't answer my question!,
32157,SUPPORT,He doesn't care what we have to say. Forget about it.,
32157,SUPPORT,"No, you told me you had nothing to do with this.
I can't just leave it alone.",
32157,SUPPORT,"Yes, you can. And you don't need to worry about it.",
32157,SUPPORT,"But I do! What if they pressured you into confessing
something you hadn't actually done?",
32157,SUPPORT,"They mean well, but they seem to think they have
good reasons to suspect you.",
32157,SUPPORT,"Those suspicions could lead to forceful questioning.
They'll do anything to get to the bottom of this.",
32157,SUPPORT,"You're probably right. If he has his way, they'll do
whatever they can to pin it on me.",
32157,SUPPORT,"What about you? There isn't some part of you that
agrees with that creep?",
32157,SUPPORT,"No. I know you don't sigh unless you absolutely
can't help it.",
32157,SUPPORT,"You would never endanger people like that unless
something pushed you over the edge.",
32157,SUPPORT,"I know this wasn't your fault. You said as much,
and I believe you.",
32157,SUPPORT,"That's sweet...but unfortunately your conviction
isn't good for much on its own. We have no proof.",
32157,SUPPORT,"Then we'll find proof! If you didn't cause it, then
something else did. We just have to find out what.",
32157,SUPPORT,"I'll investigate the site where we were attacked.
There could be a monster nest nearby.",
32157,SUPPORT,"You're so darn trusting, Freckles. For all you know,
I could be lying.",
32157,SUPPORT,"Your commitment to honesty is as strong as mine.
You'd never turn your back on our common bond!",
32157,SUPPORT,...,
32157,SUPPORT,You're just like the Luna Knight!,
32157,SUPPORT,"Hey, come on! I was being serious!",
32157,SUPPORT,"Sorry! I'm not laughing at you, I promise.",
32157,SUPPORT,"I guess part of me was hoping to meet one of those
storybook heroes. Now I finally have.",
32157,SUPPORT,"If that's how you feel...then I'm going to live up to it.
I'll do my best to make sure you never sigh again!",
32158,SUPPORT,"Stupid rain! Go back to the stupid cloud you
came from. I'm soaked...",
32158,SUPPORT,Achoo! What a pain.,
32158,SUPPORT,"Hapi? Yikes, you look like you just crawled out of
a lake. Here, dry yourself off.",
32158,SUPPORT,"And don't just stand there, you'll catch a cold.
Come on, I'll make you some tea.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Oh. Um, OK.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Huh. It's been ages since I had a nice cup of tea
during a rainstorm. Pretty nice, eh?",
32158,SUPPORT,"I don't drink tea very often. It is nice. But what does
the rain have to do with anything?",
32158,SUPPORT,"Doesn't rain make you want to read a book?
Or rather, nap with a book on your lap. Though...
I guess I'd like that no matter the weather.",
32158,SUPPORT,"But then, if the book is too good, not only will I be
unable to sleep, my tea would get cold...",
32158,SUPPORT,"That makes brewing it a wasted effort. Ah...
And that's why I don't drink tea when it rains.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Right. Thanks for clearing that up. And thanks for
the cup of tea.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Well, I'm pretty much dry now. Gotta say though,
I'm kinda confused.",
32158,SUPPORT,Huh? About what?,
32158,SUPPORT,This just seems way out of character for you.,
32158,SUPPORT,"You're so focused on yourself, you've barely ever
spoken to me before now.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Oh, good point. Thing is, I'm not cut out for battle.",
32158,SUPPORT,"If a fight breaks out, I'm only a liability. It's better for
everyone if I keep my distance.",
32158,SUPPORT,"What does fighting have to do with... Oh, I get it.
You think I'm gonna sigh.",
32158,SUPPORT,"You're just like the others... But if that's true, why
are you acting so different?",
32158,SUPPORT,"What do you mean? Use your words to make the
things in your head make sense to the rest of us.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Fine! Here's what's in my head. I don't understand
why you're being nice to me.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Look around us. Nobody else will even risk coming
near me.",
32158,SUPPORT,"They're probably afraid you'll sigh, since you looked
pretty rough when we came in. Makes sense.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Your sighs are disastrous. If I can prevent one with a
nice, lazy cup of tea, it's the least I can do.",
32158,SUPPORT,I see. You did it for your own sake.,
32158,SUPPORT,"Well, whatever your reasons, I'm surprised that
you'd even consider doing this...for me.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Surprised or not, it's no skin off my back. I'll keep
doing what I do regardless of anyone's expectations.",
32158,SUPPORT,"Think on that. I expected you to be a hazard, but
you weren't. No harm, no foul. No need to sigh.",
32158,SUPPORT,If only it were that simple.,
32159,SUPPORT,Ahhhh...,
32159,SUPPORT,"...Mm, that was some good sleep. How nice it
is to enjoy the sunrise all by my—",
32159,SUPPORT,"Good, you're finally awake.",
32159,SUPPORT,"AH! Who's that?! Oh no, I'm falling! Oh no, I'm
emoting! Calm...",
32159,SUPPORT,Wait! No!,
32159,SUPPORT,That...hurt.,
32159,SUPPORT,"You're telling me. Do you normally start your day
by startling people out of trees?",
32159,SUPPORT,"Not normally, no. Sorry, but I couldn't wait.",
32159,SUPPORT,"Couldn't wait? It's so early. You must have stayed up
all night.",
32159,SUPPORT,"Huh, I suppose I did. How unusual. That's what
happens when you get carried away with research.",
32159,SUPPORT,"Then I remembered what we talked about, so I've
been waiting here for you to wake up.",
32159,SUPPORT,"Well, here I am, wide awake. How can I help you?",
32159,SUPPORT,"I found an interesting document about
Saint Timotheos.",
32159,SUPPORT,"There are some fascinating things down in that place
you and your buddies call home.",
32159,SUPPORT,Timotheos? That's—,
32159,SUPPORT,"The saint whose Major Crest you bear. His bloodline
was believed to have died out a thousand years ago.",
32159,SUPPORT,"It's theorized that your Crest and the Crest of
Lamine have similar powers. Oh, Lamine was
one of the 10 Elites.",
32159,SUPPORT,"Here's the best part. Turns out this Timotheos guy
had the power to summon beasts.",
32159,SUPPORT,I'm listening...,
32159,SUPPORT,"Take a look at this passage. The writing's kind of
antiquated, but at least it's legible...",
32159,SUPPORT,"""Saint Timotheos could converse fluently with birds
and land-borne beasts, and he considered these
creatures his friends.",
32159,SUPPORT,"""He sometimes rode over hills atop an obliging deer
or called wolves to encircle him in battle.",
32159,SUPPORT,"""His sigh, inflected with the power of the night-
bringer's star, was immensely sonorous...""",
32159,SUPPORT,Nice recitation. So there you go.,
32159,SUPPORT,That's just how people from my village write.,
32159,SUPPORT,"Is that...so. Huh. Anyway, this obviously reminded
me of you and your situation.",
32159,SUPPORT,"You clearly have this same astral power, but to an
excessive degree.",
32159,SUPPORT,"And for some reason, it only manifests for you when
you sigh.",
32159,SUPPORT,Does that mean you can fix it?,
32159,SUPPORT,"Oh goodness, no. Or, I should say, it's unlikely.
There's next to no documentation about this stuff.",
32159,SUPPORT,"And I don't know nearly enough about the other
Crests either.",
32159,SUPPORT,"And Timotheos. Again, nothing to go on. It's near
impossible to unravel, so don't get your hopes up.",
32159,SUPPORT,"Heh, you know me... I'm good at keeping my
expectations nice and low.",
32160,SUPPORT,"Ugh, this path isn't the right way either. Why do
epic quests always involve a lot of legwork?",
32160,SUPPORT,"Well, Abyss is a big place. Maybe it's time to start on
your next epic quest—giving up and going home.",
32160,SUPPORT,"People are dying up there, after all. We don't have
time for this sort of thing.",
32160,SUPPORT,What sort of thing? You?,
32160,SUPPORT,"I'd say you're way more important than the pursuit
of war. More interesting too.",
32160,SUPPORT,"Yeah, I'm the next big thing in Crestology.
How flattering.",
32160,SUPPORT,"You gotta stop saying things like that or someone
might get the wrong idea. Lucky for you, I'm used
to your weirdness by now.",
32160,SUPPORT,"I'm sorry my sincerity rubbed you the wrong way.
I meant what I said, but that's fine.",
32160,SUPPORT,Now back to your ability...,
32160,SUPPORT,"I've discovered that this power can be attributed to
your blood. The magic originates from your Crest.",
32160,SUPPORT,"There have been leaps and bounds in research on
summoning magic focused on an arbitrary target.",
32160,SUPPORT,"The only remaining problems are perception and
distance. Though, it could be argued—",
32160,SUPPORT,"Blah, blah, big words, blah. I don't even get what
you're saying.",
32160,SUPPORT,"You don't have to understand it to appreciate
its implications.",
32160,SUPPORT,"Here's the connection—once we understand your
power, it's essential that we have a theoretical
grasp on how to control it.",
32160,SUPPORT,"All right, all right. I'll do my best.",
32160,SUPPORT,That...isn't as scientific as what I had in mind.,
32160,SUPPORT,"I'll probably need your help wrapping my head
around the theoretical stuff. You up for that?",
32160,SUPPORT,"No pressure. Well, people might die if you say no,
so some pressure, I guess?",
32160,SUPPORT,Huh? Why me?! Ugh... I guess it can't be helped.,
32160,SUPPORT,"I suppose foisting this task on Professor Hanneman
would be a waste of my precious efforts...",
32160,SUPPORT,"This isn't what I had in mind, but I guess I'm the
only man for the job, come to think of it.",
32160,SUPPORT,"Sounds great... Hey, if you're tired, there's no shame
in calling it a day and heading back to the surface.",
32160,SUPPORT,"It's more walking than I expected. I've lost sleep
over this. But you're way more important than a...",
32160,SUPPORT,"Oh, right. You don't like me when I'm sincere.",
32160,SUPPORT,"Welp, let's get on with the adventure, then.
We'll check out that hidden passage next.",
32160,SUPPORT,"We've got to find that book that Timotheos is said
to have left behind. Come along.",
32160,SUPPORT,"Fine. But what if we don't find the book and you
can't figure out a way to solve this?",
32160,SUPPORT,"I've come this far. Now I've got to see it through to
the end. How will I ever nap in peace otherwise?",

In the Alliance, I'm known as a...how should I put it?",
32211,SUPPORT,A hero?,
32211,SUPPORT,An outlaw?,
32211,SUPPORT,"Heh, something like that. To be precise, I'm known
as the Undisputed King of Grappling!",
32211,SUPPORT,"Right answer! This guy's notorious for picking fights
and shirking debts. He's got a whole army of bounty
hunters chasing after him.",
32211,SUPPORT,"I may not look it, but I was once a noble from a
minor house. Life's full of twists and turns.",

into this mess.",

princess herself?",

have imagined you'd end up in a place like this...",

could you have here?",

too far off the beaten path.",

around, there's bound to be trouble.",

unique town, is it not?",

on the surface are able to find sanctuary here.",
32211,SUPPORT,"Oh, not to say that there's no helping the situation

32211,SUPPORT,"Even so, I find the idea...rather lovely.",

the monastery?",

secrets—oh, I'm just itching to know them all!",

how many secrets does that lady have?",

of theirs?",

monastery. And their collection is amazing.",

spells, and heresies. Doubt I'll catch a single 
wink tonight.",

their unwanted belongings.",
32211,SUPPORT,"I didn't expect to find much, but there's actually
plenty of gear we could salvage.",
32211,SUPPORT,"I'm told we can take anything we can use, so it might
be good to check on it now and again.",

It's about you outsiders. Actually... Guess I shouldn't
bother reporting you to yourself.",

harmless. Honestly? Things can get pretty boring
down here.",

boredom's a luxury. Trust me. I know these things.",

down here...",

ones too shady to walk in the goddess's light.",

up, and he said I shouldn't ever say stuff like that.",

I grew up, and he said I'd grow up boring! What do
they want me to say?!",

choice. A petty squabble could start an all-out war.",

agenda. Isn't that right, Yuri?",
32212,SUPPORT,"Cheeky...and off base. What do you think, friend?
Do you think I'm off plotting nefarious deeds?",
32212,SUPPORT,"Yes, I do.",
32212,SUPPORT,"No, I don't.",
32212,SUPPORT,Ha ha ha! Brutally honest... I love it.,
32212,SUPPORT,"Ha ha! Not very perceptive, are we?",
32212,SUPPORT,"Even so, that's a bit much, wouldn't you say? I do
what I need to get by—nothing more than that.",
32212,SUPPORT,"As for the others, they've all got their own struggles,
but they're nothing if not trustworthy.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Humbling yourself while promoting your friends...
Gotta say, I don't hate this side of you.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Seems we're in mutual neutrality of one another.
I like that you keep your cards close. We'll get
along just fine, you and I.",
32212,SUPPORT,"I've got a lot of time on my hands down here, so I've
been venturing even deeper underground.",
32212,SUPPORT,"This place is loaded with winding paths and
blocked-off tunnels. It's a real maze.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Only a few folks even know how to operate the gate
mechanisms and hidden passages.",
32212,SUPPORT,Gate mechanisms?,
32212,SUPPORT,Hidden passages?,
32212,SUPPORT,"That's what I said. Activate the mechanism, and the
gate slams shut. Bang!",
32212,SUPPORT,"That's what I said. Things will shift without notice
here, revealing hidden passages. Walls. Floors.
Everything. Gotta stay sharp.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Actually, I'll level with you. Yuri and Constance are
much better at scoping out that kind of thing, heh.",
32212,SUPPORT,"The records should be here some— Oh!
Hello, Professor. It's good that you've come.",
32212,SUPPORT,"I realized that I missed an opportunity to
congratulate myself on my military achievements.",
32212,SUPPORT,"But now that you're here, I have an audience for it.
Indulge me, won't you?",
32212,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! Behold the proof that the utmost honor in
combat belongs to none other than I, Constance
von Nuvelle!",
32212,SUPPORT,"What a relief to get that off my chest! Now, where
did Aelfric get to? I must have words with him.",
32212,SUPPORT,"You've only been on the job a few moons, huh?
No wonder you don't come off as a mindless church
flunky.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Plus, you don't flap your trap all the time.
I appreciate that.",
32212,SUPPORT,"I hope you never change, no matter how many years
you spend with the annoying people up there.",
32212,SUPPORT,"The Ashen Wolves got their name from the beasts
who guard the Blue Sea Star.",
32212,SUPPORT,"The archbishop named the house herself, in fact.",
32212,SUPPORT,"In spite of that, it seems she looks unfavorably upon
our house of late. This saddens me greatly.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Pardon the odd question, but something has been
bothering me for a while now. Your hair...was it
always that color?",
32212,SUPPORT,"That is an odd question. But yes, if you must know,
it was a different color when I was a child.",
32212,SUPPORT,"How could you know that? Is it possible that we met
before the academy?",
32212,SUPPORT,What are you two talking about?,
32212,SUPPORT,Your hair changed color?,
32212,SUPPORT,It's...a long story. Now is not the time or place.,
32212,SUPPORT,"Yes, of course. My apologies.",
32212,SUPPORT,"The Four Apostles... Gah, this is killing me!
I'm on the verge of remembering something.",
32212,SUPPORT,"I can't shake the feeling that one of their names is...
also a food or something.",
32212,SUPPORT,"I've only had the chance to speak with Aelfric briefly,
but he seems like a respectable man.",
32212,SUPPORT,"It's obvious the whole town has a lot of affection
for him.",
32212,SUPPORT,Kind of reminds me of Lonato in that way...,
32212,SUPPORT,"Had a chance to poke your head in here, Professor?
It's a fortune-teller's room!",
32212,SUPPORT,"Judging by all her mystical-looking doodads, I think
she's the real deal too.",
32212,SUPPORT,"I wonder if she does matchmaking. Maybe she can
help me sort through my countless suitors.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.
The bandit sightings have stopped. For now.
I still won't let my guard down, though!",
32212,SUPPORT,"What else... Notice how everyone's in high spirits?
Know why? I do. It's because Master Aelfric is here.",
32212,SUPPORT,"He's real special, that one. He saved my life and lots
of others here too. He's earned some hero worship.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Don't suppose you're here for a drink, huh.
They aren't any better, I'll tell ya right now.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Maybe folks down here wouldn't be so awful if they
could get their hands on something worth tasting.",
32212,SUPPORT,Who am I kidding... Nobles are just as bad.,
32212,SUPPORT,"I heard Aelfric came to Yuri's rescue in the attack
that happened recently.",
32212,SUPPORT,"That's just what you'd expect from someone as kind
and strong as he is.",
32212,SUPPORT,I can't believe he's single...,
32212,SUPPORT,"Abyss is a sprawling place. Some houses, like mine,
are actually quite far from the center of town.",
32212,SUPPORT,"What brings me all the way here then, you ask?",
32212,SUPPORT,"I came to see Aelfric. Even a glimpse of him is said
to bring good luck.",
32212,SUPPORT,"For folks who've lost their homes on the surface,
Abyss is all they've got.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Place used to be nothing more than a den of
criminals who did whatever they pleased.",
32212,SUPPORT,"Now, we've got Aelfric to keep an eye on things.",
32212,SUPPORT,"He understands that keeping people fed's the way
to keep 'em calm.",
32212,SUPPORT,"There was a time when I did much fighting.
Then I was captured. Then...I escaped.",
32212,SUPPORT,"My home is far away now. My mother is waiting
for me, but returning is... It is far away.",
32212,SUPPORT,I worry that I will be here until I am very old.,
32212,SUPPORT,Sometimes Aelfric gives out candy!,
32212,SUPPORT,"Stick close by him, and you might get some too.
But save a little for me, OK?",
32212,SUPPORT,Don't annoy Hapi or make her feel disappointed.,
32212,SUPPORT,You mustn't. Not ever! OK?,
32213,SUPPORT,"Things were dicey for a bit there. Gotta say I'm
relieved that no harm befell anyone in Abyss.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I've made sure that the elderly and children are
hidden in their homes. They need to stay safe.",
32213,SUPPORT,What can I do to help?,
32213,SUPPORT,Smart move.,
32213,SUPPORT,"Nothing right now. But I might call on you for a
favor later.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Comes naturally to me. When I say jump, my rogues
jump. That's why they call me boss.",
32213,SUPPORT,"So that's the deal. People are safe for now. But I can't
shake the feeling that something's just...off.",
32213,SUPPORT,"All we can do at this point is focus on the problem
staring us in the face.",
32213,SUPPORT,"You ask me, we can't expect to just mosey on by,
hand over the chalice, and make it out alive.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Nothing sounds better than saving Aelfric and
roughing up the jerks who took him. It's just...",
32213,SUPPORT,"Well, as the Relentless King of Grappling, I'll be
fine. But I'm worried about the others.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Might I have a word? It concerns the blackguards
who abducted Aelfric.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I alluded to it before, but I sincerely believe there
is a spy in Abyss.",
32213,SUPPORT,I doubt that.,
32213,SUPPORT,I think you're right.,
32213,SUPPORT,"I see... Well, I shall drop the matter if you think
it best.",
32213,SUPPORT,"We are in agreement, then?",
32213,SUPPORT,"Yuri is exceedingly devoted to his friends, but there
are times that he can be a bit too trusting.",
32213,SUPPORT,We've gotta get Elfie back.,
32213,SUPPORT,"I was abducted once, when I was younger. My captor
used me as a test subject in her twisted experiments.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Maybe we can just give them the chalice and they'll
release him unharmed.",
32213,SUPPORT,"The identities of the cardinals are a closely guarded
secret of the church.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Yet Aelfric's status was disclosed in that letter. Could
this signal a power struggle within the church?",
32213,SUPPORT,"Or perhaps that's what they want us to believe.
Either way, we should pay close attention.",
32213,SUPPORT,"According to the legend that Aelfric shared with us,
the chalice has the power to bring back the dead.",
32213,SUPPORT,Are his captors hoping to resurrect someone?,
32213,SUPPORT,"Hmm. Or perhaps they simply intend to sell it for
an exorbitant payoff...",
32213,SUPPORT,"So it turns out ol' Aelfric is a cardinal, huh? Hard to
imagine such an important figure getting abducted.",
32213,SUPPORT,"And whoever took him somehow knows we have
the chalice.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I bet they know how to use the thing too. I doubt
they just plan to decorate their mantle with it.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I was speaking with Hapi earlier, and it dawned on
me that she may possess a unique Crest.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Perhaps it's linked to the Four Apostles. If so, then in
the chasm... No. There isn't enough to back that up.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Hm? Oh, sorry, Professor. I need to think on this
longer before sharing my theories.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Aelfric's been taken hostage... Who could do such
a dishonorable thing?",
32213,SUPPORT,"It doesn't matter. Abyss needs him. We've got to
form a rescue party.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I just hope we're not getting in over our heads.
We don't exactly know what we're dealing with.",
32213,SUPPORT,"We were hoping the chalice would protect Abyss,
but it's the reason Aelfric got captured. That's ironic.",
32213,SUPPORT,"The people here really adore him. I'm sure they'd
appreciate our help getting him back.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Then again, are we getting too involved? Maybe we
should leave before we make things any worse.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.
And it's me. I...I'm a failure. A farce. An insult to
the noble title of Abysskeeper.",
32213,SUPPORT,"Master Aelfric's done so much for me. I wanted to
pay him back one day, but instead...I let this happen.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I'll never make this up to him. Ugh! I'm disgusted
with myself! Don't look at me—I'm a monster.",
32213,SUPPORT,"It all happened so fast. They forced their way in
and took Aelfric. There was nothing I could do.",
32213,SUPPORT,"We all wanted to fight, but Aelfric stopped us.",
32213,SUPPORT,"He always thinks of others first...even if it means
sacrificing himself.",
32213,SUPPORT,"The leader of the group that took Aelfric...
I've seen him before.",
32213,SUPPORT,"He wouldn't hesitate to slaughter an entire town...
if he stood to gain even a little by it.",
32213,SUPPORT,His laugh chills me to the bone...,
32213,SUPPORT,"The Ashen Wolves are strong. I don't think even
they can do this on their own...",
32213,SUPPORT,"You'll lend them a hand, won't you, Professor?
Please, save Aelfric!",
32213,SUPPORT,Aelfric is a prominent figure in the church.,
32213,SUPPORT,"If the archbishop hears what happened, she might
send the Knights of Seiros.",
32213,SUPPORT,"That'd make things complicated. Folks down here
don't trust 'em.",
32213,SUPPORT,"I have seen nothing. I have been here in this place,
where I always am.",
32213,SUPPORT,"You cannot think it was me who did something.
I am full of innocence!",
32213,SUPPORT,"It's gotten pretty dangerous around here, so we've
sent all the children back to their homes.",
32213,SUPPORT,I hope Aelfric's all right...,
32214,SUPPORT,"I suppose it's all out in the open. Now you know just
what I'm capable of.",
32214,SUPPORT,"The church would have destroyed me ages ago if it
wasn't for a certain someone having my back.",
32214,SUPPORT,"My life was spared... It's a debt I intend to pay, no
matter the cost.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Ah! My head's gonna explode if I keep thinking
about all this complicated junk.",
32214,SUPPORT,"For now, we just need to focus on rescuing Aelfric
and sniffing out some answers.",
32214,SUPPORT,"I know it's been one crisis after another, but you're
still game to help us, yeah? We need you, pal.",
32214,SUPPORT,Is Aelfric an enemy or an ally?,
32214,SUPPORT,"He's worked tirelessly to protect Abyss for years
and years.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Yet had House Nuvelle not met such a terrible fate,
I would never have come to Garreg Mach.",
32214,SUPPORT,"And Noa's bloodline would never... Can his
kidnapping really be a simple coincidence? Or...",
32214,SUPPORT,"The Four Apostles... Finally, it makes sense.",
32214,SUPPORT,What do you mean?,
32214,SUPPORT,"Oh, yeah. For sure.",
32214,SUPPORT,"I never understood why my village was hidden away
from the rest of the world.",
32214,SUPPORT,But now I finally get it. What a relief.,
32214,SUPPORT,"You don't even know what I was going to say.
Nobody likes a faker.",
32214,SUPPORT,The descendants of the Four Apostles... Fascinating.,
32214,SUPPORT,"To think that their bloodlines carried on in secret.
Right under our noses, one was even disguised as
Imperial nobility...",
32214,SUPPORT,"House Nuvelle was thought to be descended from
Saint Macuil, but that was a fabrication.",
32214,SUPPORT,"How did they manage to avoid detection for so
many generations?",
32214,SUPPORT,"The lost Crests... Aelfric's objective... Since our
journey's outset, the mystery has only deepened.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Ah, please forgive me. Musing aloud isn't going to
get us anywhere.",
32214,SUPPORT,"For now, let's finish our preparations. I fear a battle
is imminent.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Those lost Crests... They must all have their own
Relics, don't you think?",
32214,SUPPORT,"Eh, but before we dig into a new mystery, we'd better
figure out the ones we're already working on.",
32214,SUPPORT,"I have a theory, but... Actually, scratch that. No use
guessing when our answers await at the chapel ruins.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Huh. I can't believe my wild hypothesis was correct.
I may not look it, but I'm shocked.",
32214,SUPPORT,"It's like casting a line and thinking you've landed the
Big One...but then you reel it in, and it's Seteth.",
32214,SUPPORT,"OK, that was a weird analogy. The point is I'm very,
very shocked.",
32214,SUPPORT,"To be honest, I'm surprised Lady Rhea was so willing
to just...hand over the chalice like that.",
32214,SUPPORT,Doesn't the church consider it important?,
32214,SUPPORT,"I know she said they wouldn't be able to use it,
but something doesn't feel right.",
32214,SUPPORT,"We go to all that trouble bringing Lady Rhea a
priceless artifact, and not so much as a thank-you?",
32214,SUPPORT,"We had to release the binding and everything. Well,
I mean, it kind of released on its own—but still!",
32214,SUPPORT,"Let's wrap this up and head home so I can get some
quality sauna time. Hilda needs a steaming.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.
Guess that's pretty usual here. Maybe it's not worth
reporting? Perhaps I should say...nothing to report?",
32214,SUPPORT,"Nah. Tried it on, doesn't feel right. In any case,
about Master Aelfric... Bring him back to us, OK?",
32214,SUPPORT,"For my part, I'll look after things down here. If our
enemy shows up, I'll stay by my post! I mean, I have
to eat and stuff, but I'll come right back. Count on it.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Maybe you think this is a bad time to talk about
what we drink down here... But I'm gonna anyway.",
32214,SUPPORT,"See, the problem isn't in the local ingredients.
It's what's getting shipped in that's the issue.",
32214,SUPPORT,"With the right equipment, we could probably make
our own. Cut out the need to import anything...
Hell, maybe we could even export some of it!",
32214,SUPPORT,"As soon as Aelfric's back, I'm gonna see what he
thinks of the idea.",
32214,SUPPORT,"So, uh...make sure Aelfric comes back safe, all right?",
32214,SUPPORT,"If the church knows that Aelfric's been abducted,
why haven't the Knights of Seiros done anything?",
32214,SUPPORT,"I know you're all doing your best. I just hope it'll
be enough.",
32214,SUPPORT,We can't afford to lose him.,
32214,SUPPORT,Yuri somehow always keeps his cool.,
32214,SUPPORT,"He's closer with Aelfric than anyone, so he's got the
most reason to be upset...",
32214,SUPPORT,"I'm sure he's just really good at hiding the same
feelings we're all having.",
32214,SUPPORT,"If Aelfric dies, Abyss'll go right back to being the
garbage dump it was before.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Won't matter too much for an old codger like
myself, but... Ah, but the kids...",
32214,SUPPORT,It'd be hard to see their hopes for the future crushed.,
32214,SUPPORT,"There is danger here because we could be attacked.
But the same danger is there for me on the surface.",
32214,SUPPORT,The only way to leave the danger is to disappear.,
32214,SUPPORT,"It was surface people who took Aelfric away.
But you're from the surface too.",
32214,SUPPORT,"Maybe only...some surface people are the worst.
Anyway, good luck!",
32214,SUPPORT,The Ashen Wolves can take on anything.,
32214,SUPPORT,"They'll make sure it all turns out OK, won't they?",
32221,SUPPORT,"Hello there! Are you that new professor everyone's
talking about?",
32221,SUPPORT,"Name's Anna. I'm a merchant who slings wares all
across Fódlan...and beyond!",
32221,SUPPORT,"I come in here all the time, so I'm sure our paths will
cross more. Hopefully much more!",
32221,SUPPORT,"Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin?",
32221,SUPPORT,"I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now.
Working. For money. You understand.",
32221,SUPPORT,"I've been hearing about you a lot lately. Word on the
street is you wield some amazing sword.",
32221,SUPPORT,"If you ever want to sell it to me, I'd pay top G!
Just kidding. Sorta. It's, uh, not for sale, is it?",
32221,SUPPORT,"I heard Jeralt passed away...
My deepest condolences. ",
32221,SUPPORT,I knew him long before I ever even met you...,
32221,SUPPORT,"He was always so much fun to be around...
It's such a loss...",
32221,SUPPORT,"Hey, Professor. You seem...different.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Lots of things seem...different around here lately.
I've noticed it. Have you?",
32221,SUPPORT,"I can't believe the Empire raised an army...
Even I couldn't have guessed it.",
32221,SUPPORT,"War is profitable...but dangerous. I really don't
like seeing people I care about out there mixed
up in all this.",
32221,SUPPORT,"There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my
fellow merchants seem to be endangered.",
32221,SUPPORT,"I hope things go back to normal soon. People need
more to smile about, aside from my great deals.",
32221,SUPPORT,"A class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak.
That must have been so hard on everyone.",
32221,SUPPORT,"You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean,
they still look to you for guidance, you know?",
32221,SUPPORT,The Alliance is just...gone. It's hard to believe.,
32221,SUPPORT,"The merchants of Derdriu all have nerves of steel.
I'm sure they'll be up and running again in no time.",
32221,SUPPORT,Seems like the war is gonna end soon.,
32221,SUPPORT,"Once the dust settles, it'll be back to rolling in fat
stacks of gold for me!",
32221,SUPPORT,"I can tell that things will settle down soon enough.
Gotta get back to slinging wares and making moolah!",
32221,SUPPORT,And hopefully no more messes to spoil it after this...,
32221,SUPPORT,It's you.,
32221,SUPPORT,What are you doing here?,
32221,SUPPORT,It's been a while.,
32221,SUPPORT,I am an Imperial general.,
32221,SUPPORT,Shorter than you think.,
32221,SUPPORT,"I've seen you a number of times. In the Holy
Mausoleum, the underground chamber, and
the village...",
32221,SUPPORT,"Some know me as the Death Knight. It's a shame that
I cannot fight you at present.",
32221,SUPPORT,You've survived. How very fortunate...,
32221,SUPPORT,"Were you dead, I wouldn't be able to fight you.
But you are very much alive—now I've a chance
to kill you.",
32221,SUPPORT,What is it?,
32221,SUPPORT,I just want to chat a bit.,
32221,SUPPORT,Nothing.,
32221,SUPPORT,"I have no words for you. I have blades, and if you
wish to cross them, I'll be more than happy to.
Although you may not be.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Leave, then. I feel a nearly uncontrollable urge to
destroy you.",
32221,SUPPORT,"I was told not to, however, so I will hold off. Until
the war ends.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Neither the emperor nor the Empire have
my allegiance.",
32221,SUPPORT,"It is all simply part of the agreement. There is no
other reason for me to be here.",
32221,SUPPORT,"The Knights of Seiros... They certainly know how to
inflict pain. However.",
32221,SUPPORT,"The demon within me will be satiated only by
fighting you.",
32221,SUPPORT,"The war is at its end. Has the time finally come that
I might kill you?",
32221,SUPPORT,The battle will continue even beyond the war.,
32221,SUPPORT,There's no guarantee that we'll win next time.,
32221,SUPPORT,"It is true... Those petulant fleas must be picked off
one by one. They are nothing if not persistent.",
32221,SUPPORT,"And if we do not win, then we die. Either has
its charms.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Hey, Professor! Fancy meeting you here! I've got a
business— Uh, I mean, I've got something I want to
chat with you about.",
32221,SUPPORT,"I know you're busy with a lot of things, but I was
wondering if I might be able to join you.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Heck, I won't even charge you for my aid! What say
you? It's a killer deal!",
32221,SUPPORT,"Yes, please join us.",
32221,SUPPORT,"No, thanks.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Thank you! Now I'll have plenty of time to get
to know my clients better.",
32221,SUPPORT,"A merchant needs to know the inner workings of
everyone they come in contact with. Helps with the
making of the monies, you know.",
32221,SUPPORT,"You sure you wanna pass up a deal this good?
You just let me know if you change your mind.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Abyss? You're interested in that place, are you?",
32221,SUPPORT,"Ancient sprawling remains deep below
Garreg Mach... That's Abyss.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Some folks have made their home there. Obviously
they all have their reasons and tales to tell.",
32221,SUPPORT,"But only the most enterprising merchant
would venture near it. My advice? Avoid
going there yourself.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Fighting as an Imperial general is
mind-numbingly dull...",
32221,SUPPORT,Joining you would be a welcome distraction.,
32221,SUPPORT,You are welcome to come along.,
32221,SUPPORT,You'd better stay and attend to your post.,
32221,SUPPORT,Indeed. I would relish the opportunity.,
32221,SUPPORT,It was merely a passing whim.,
32221,SUPPORT,"Things we can't obtain here are likely obtainable by
way of the underground.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Are you unfamiliar with Garreg Mach's
underground? The place is an absolute paradise
for those who can't stay above ground.",
32221,SUPPORT,"Those Abyssian idiots. All they ever do is
cause trouble.",
32221,SUPPORT,"We'd best purge the entire underbelly of
Garreg Mach.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Ah, I see. So you are Jeralt's child. You so resemble
your mother.",
32222,SUPPORT,Did you know my mother?,
32222,SUPPORT,Who might you be?,
32222,SUPPORT,"I did indeed. I was acquainted with your parents.
I've been wanting to speak with you for a while now.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I am nothing more than a common monk. I knew
your parents...once upon a time.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I've been gone from the monastery for some time
now because... Well, it matters not.",
32222,SUPPORT,Might I...ask a favor of you?,
32222,SUPPORT,"Do you mind terribly picking up some fresh flowers
to place upon your mother's grave?",
32222,SUPPORT,"I am certain she'd be deeply moved to receive a gift
from you.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Thank you so much. This is just the type of flower
she once loved so dearly.",
32222,SUPPORT,I can rest easy now.,
32222,SUPPORT,"I must be off. Take especially good care of yourself,
won't you?",
32222,SUPPORT,"Please, look after Jeralt. She'd have wanted that.",
32222,SUPPORT,"The next mission is to rout bandits in the Kingdom,
is it not? I find the idea unsettling.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Though the bandits have captured a large prize,
they are insigificant in and of themselves.",
32222,SUPPORT,"The matter would be more appropriately dealt with
by Margrave Gautier or the Faerghus royal family.",
32222,SUPPORT,I grant that I am most likely jumping at shadows...,
32222,SUPPORT,"But I fear that if Faerghus is weakened, the tipped
scales will lead to widespread unrest.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Not even the tragedy in Remire Village will stop the
surface dwellers from getting jazzed about a party.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I get that they're probably seeking a distraction, but
it still feels pretty damn selfish if you ask me.",
32222,SUPPORT,Everyone feels the pain.,
32222,SUPPORT,"We must move ahead, despite the pain.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Look, I get it. I'm still gonna speak my piece
about it.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Ha, gotta keep things upbeat, I suppose. Sorry for
grousing. It just got me down is all.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Things have quieted down, but nothing has been
resolved. Better stay alert.",
32222,SUPPORT,"So? Did you need something? Don't tell me you want
me in on that whole ""cup"" business.",
32222,SUPPORT,"(Should I choose Yuri as our house representative
in the White Heron Cup dance contest...)",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Ugh. I figured. All right, all right. I'll do it to make
up for my negativity.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Good. I can't stand being in the spotlight, even
though people seem to enjoy it when I am.",
32222,SUPPORT,"The least you can do is practice some moves with
me, since you insist on roping me into this, yeah?",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Well, guess I'm in for it...",
32222,SUPPORT,"Wow, and you call yourself a professor? You'd better
uphold that title and help me out later.",
32222,SUPPORT,"That was easier than I anticipated. So glad that's all
over and done with.",
32222,SUPPORT,"My opponents were exceptionally talented.
I certainly tried my hardest.",
32222,SUPPORT,"The ball really brings back memories. Heh, had
some wild times back when I was first enrolled here.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Ladies used to line up around the block for a chance
to dance with the Debonair King of Grappling.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Huh? The White Heron Cup? That's...new.
Guessing you're looking to sign me up, yeah?",
32222,SUPPORT,"Thanks, but no thanks, pal. Gotta save myself for
the battlefield and all. You know how it goes.",
32222,SUPPORT,"(Should I choose Balthus as our house representative
in the White Heron Cup dance contest...)",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Did you not just hear me say no? Ugh, what did I do
to deserve this? ...Oh, right. Lots of stuff. Well, fine.
Have it your way.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Don't forget that I'm the one who turned you down.
I mean, just so we're clear and all.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. Let's practice brawl... Er, ballroom
dancing, yeah? It's been a while since the king
hit the floor.",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Was that...good? Or too smooth? Should I flex more?
Ya know, for extra points?",
32222,SUPPORT,"Brutal... But I've survived worse. I'll just have to win
this thing all on my lonesome!",
32222,SUPPORT,"Ha! The king reigns supreme! I'd be thrilled if this
weren't a prance-around-like-an-idiot contest.
Ah well. A win's a win.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Well, there goes my chance at being crowned the
king of prancing around like an idiot.",
32222,SUPPORT,"What could I possibly do at a formal ball? I've no
status, and I'm not much of a dancer.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I think it would be best if I stayed put in Abyss,
far from view of anyone.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I hear that there is to be an elegant dance contest
known as the White Heron Cup.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Though I have no more familiarity with dance than
any young noblewoman would.",
32222,SUPPORT,"(Should I choose Constance as our house
representative in the White Heron Cup
dance contest...)",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"You flatter me, but you must know that my chances
of winning are slim.",
32222,SUPPORT,"In other circumstances, I might have leapt at the
opportunity. But your decision was a wise one.",
32222,SUPPORT,"They tell me that you can teach proper dancing
form. Do you suppose that I could learn?",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"I am grateful that you would devote your time to
mending my spotty reputation.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I thought not. There is nothing to be done but to
summon what dancing skill I already possess.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Oh... How did I come to win? Did the others eat
something that disagreed with them?",
32222,SUPPORT,"The chance to participate was already more than
I dreamed possible.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Sounds like the church has been taking in orphans
from Remire Village.",
32222,SUPPORT,"They do a good thing every once in a while, I guess.
I just hope none of those kids get locked away for
stepping out of line.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Hm? You want me to join the White Heron Cup?
Um... Dancing's really not my thing.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Neither are competitions, for that matter. You can
probably guess what happens when I lose.",
32222,SUPPORT,"(Should I choose Hapi as our house representative
in the White Heron Cup dance contest...)",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,Seriously? You can be so mean sometimes.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Good call. We don't wanna get the rumor
mill churning.",
32222,SUPPORT,"You'll at least teach me how to dance, right?",
32222,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32222,SUPPORT,No.,
32222,SUPPORT,"I know I'm bad at this, but you're not allowed to get
frustrated. Got it?",
32222,SUPPORT,"Huh. I thought you'd agree to help, seeing as this
was your idea. Well, whatever.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Gotta say, I was not expecting to win this thing.
Feels pretty good.",
32222,SUPPORT,Saw that coming. I told you I wasn't cut out for it.,
32222,SUPPORT,"So, Goneril's troops have entered Derdriu... Hmm...",
32222,SUPPORT,"Oh. Hey, pal. Didn't see you there. Guess I was lost
in thought.",
32222,SUPPORT,What happened?,
32222,SUPPORT,Goneril... Is this about Hilda?,
32222,SUPPORT,"You're a quick one, Professor.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I caught wind that Duke Goneril sent Hilda to
Derdriu.",
32222,SUPPORT,"She's the sister of my buddy, Holst. I can't let her die.
I won't! Gah, this is a terrible situation...",
32222,SUPPORT,"According to a merchant who just came from the
Alliance, my little bro made it home in one piece.",
32222,SUPPORT,"But House Albrecht lost a lot of troops. So did the
nearby lords. Things are real bad over there.",
32222,SUPPORT,"If we don't stop the Empire soon, there won't be
anyone left to help fight them off.",
32222,SUPPORT,I heard you might become the next leader of Fódlan.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Personally, I'm into the idea. If you have the chance,
you'll take it, right?",
32222,SUPPORT,I'm not sure.,
32222,SUPPORT,You think I should?,
32222,SUPPORT,"I'd say go for it. I wanna see how you'd clean up this
messy old continent of ours.",
32222,SUPPORT,That might be something I can get excited about.,
32222,SUPPORT,"I hear that damn Dimitri guy plans to chat with
the emperor. Can you believe that nonsense?",
32222,SUPPORT,"Really, though. We've been trying to kill each other,
and he wants to shoot the breeze? Is he dumb or
just insane?",
32222,SUPPORT,Maybe you're right.,
32222,SUPPORT,You're wrong.,
32222,SUPPORT,"No ""maybes"" about it, pal. You ask me, they should
settle it like civilized folk—with their fists.",
32222,SUPPORT,"That a fact? Heh, you two are birds of a feather.
You ask me, they should throw some fists and be
done with it.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Guess it's up to the One True King of Grappling to
talk some sense into ol' Dimitri. When I'm done with
him, he'll be ready to brawl!",
32222,SUPPORT,"Nader the Undefeated... With a name like that,
he's bound to put up a damn-good fight.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Did you get a good look at Judith? She practically
had hearts floating out of her eyeballs when she
looked at Nader.",
32222,SUPPORT,She must be in love.,
32222,SUPPORT,I'm not so sure about that.,
32222,SUPPORT,That's ridiculous.,
32222,SUPPORT,"You saw it too? Heh, I know that look well. She's
got it bad. Honestly, they'd make a cute couple.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Pretty dense, aren't ya? Trust me, pal. No one's
seen more heart-eyed women than this guy.
She's got it bad.",
32222,SUPPORT,"It makes all the sense. Even seasoned warriors aren't
immune to love, pal.",
32222,SUPPORT,...,
32222,SUPPORT,...,
32222,SUPPORT,What are you doing?,
32222,SUPPORT,Are you all right?,
32222,SUPPORT,What does it look like? I'm meditating.,
32222,SUPPORT,Nope. That's why I'm meditating.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Just when I think the war is over, it starts right back
up again. This is the second time that's happened.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Meditating is all I can do to hold myself together
right now.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I fear to think of what dire straits you must be in
to ask for my help.",
32222,SUPPORT,"But I would be glad to serve in whatever capacity
you would have me.",
32222,SUPPORT,I want your help with a mission.,
32222,SUPPORT,I don't need you after all.,
32222,SUPPORT,"If that is your decision, I shall not gainsay it.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I shall do my humble best to perform what is
needed of me.",
32222,SUPPORT,"That may be prudent. It is not for nothing that you
are lauded for your wisdom.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I might feel differently about the decision under
other circumstances, though.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Surprised that I'm here, are you? I know a winning
side when I see it.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I mean, there's no way I'd risk my neck and my
people by willfully joining a losing battle.",
32222,SUPPORT,You really care for them.,
32222,SUPPORT,Do you feel you chose wisely?,
32222,SUPPORT,"I do. We'll see how this all shakes out. All depends
on how we—and you—fight.",
32222,SUPPORT,"You'd better hope I did, otherwise we're both dead.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Regardless of who comes after us—even if it's the
knights—we've got you on our side, so it'll all
be fine.",
32222,SUPPORT,"What's the deal, pal? You don't want me here?
Come on, have a heart. This side is where all the
action is.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Look... I'll level with you. I want to help that
Edelgard gal achieve her goal. I mean it.",
32222,SUPPORT,"If Her Majesty gets what she's after,
my mother will...",
32222,SUPPORT,"Eh, forget it. Now's not the time. We've got to keep
our heads in the game so we can win, yeah?",
32222,SUPPORT,"Having Yuri on our side will help things. He's not
someone you want to have as an enemy.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I knew nothing of Lady Edelgard's past or of
her innermost feelings.",
32222,SUPPORT,But I know now. I persuaded her to tell all.,
32222,SUPPORT,"It would have been rude to hound her relentlessly
until she revealed herself, yes?",
32222,SUPPORT,Then that's certainly not what I did. Ahaha!,
32222,SUPPORT,"With the Empire taking over Garreg Mach...
I wonder what will happen to Abyss.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Some people have spent their whole lives there.
For their sake, I hope Abyss doesn't get trampled
into ruin.",
32222,SUPPORT,I can't guarantee anything.,
32222,SUPPORT,I promise to protect them.,
32222,SUPPORT,"Yeah. I guess all I can do is talk about it with Eddy...
I mean, Her Majesty.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Thanks. You should try talking about it with Eddy...
I mean, Her Majesty. She might listen to you.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Also, this is less important, but if somebody trashes
my room, I'm gonna be mad.",
32222,SUPPORT,...,
32222,SUPPORT,This is a rare sight.,
32222,SUPPORT,Are you praying?,
32222,SUPPORT,"How would you know what's rare and what isn't?
I still believe in the goddess, sort of.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I am. It's a bit of a ritual for me to pray before
something big like this.",
32222,SUPPORT,"I couldn't recount a single word of scripture for you.
But my mother always prayed. I picked up the habit
from her.",
32222,SUPPORT,"Believe it or not, I'm praying for you too. For you to
come back safe.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Whoever you are, it doesn't matter much to me.
But I do advise getting out of here before you get
tangled up in trouble.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Unless you've been sent here under someone's
orders. In which case, I'll happily show you a good
time. Heh heh...",
32224,SUPPORT,I got lost and stumbled upon this place.,
32224,SUPPORT,"I'd heard about Abyss, so I came to find it.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Uh-huh... I find the likelihood of you ""stumbling""
into Abyss pretty suspect.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Well, I do like people with a healthy curiosity. You
are aware of how dangerous it is down here, yeah?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hmm... You're that mercenary turned professor,
aren't you? The one who showed up at the monastery
kinda recently.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Yeah, you're the one I've heard so much about.
Well, I guess it's fine you're here, then.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You can call me Yuri. You'll want to remember that,
if you ever come down here again.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah, it's you. Bit of a trek, coming all the way down
here, huh?",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'll be helping you out now, but just so you know, my
life is still down here.",
32224,SUPPORT,"If you can't find me in the classroom on the surface,
you'll likely find me here instead.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Haven't seen your face before. You're clearly not
from around here.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You don't strike me as the thief or merchant type.
I don't owe you money, do I?",
32224,SUPPORT,"No, I'm a professor.",
32224,SUPPORT,"No, I'm a former mercenary.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah, you're that new teacher everyone's been yapping
about. And yet...you look younger than me. Weird.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah, you're that new teacher everyone's been yapping
about. Funny. Next to me, you don't look so tough.",
32224,SUPPORT,The name's Balthus. Formerly of the Alliance.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Well? Did you come all the way here just to stare at
my rippling abs, or did you want something?",
32224,SUPPORT,"If you're gonna ask me for help on the surface,
it better be real important. I try not to go up there
unless I absolutely have to.",
32224,SUPPORT,"And who might you be? Not an Abyssian, that much
is clear at a glance.",
32224,SUPPORT,"A visitor from above, perhaps? With what purpose?",
32224,SUPPORT,I'm just looking around.,
32224,SUPPORT,None in particular...,
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm sure I must have misheard you. Either that,
or you haven't the slightest inkling of where you are.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Are you mocking me? You clearly haven't the
slightest inkling of where you are!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Oh...but of course. You must be the new teacher
specially appointed by Lady Rhea. That is it, yes?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Rumors have been flying underground about you.
Well, then! I am Constance von Nuvelle.",
32224,SUPPORT,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Ahaha!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah. Come to invite me to a lesson or some such,
have you?",
32224,SUPPORT,"I prefer not to be aboveground during the day when
I can help it. Unless there are storm clouds above.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Who are you? Wait, shut up, let me guess.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're...that new professor, right? You just started
teaching up on the surface.",
32224,SUPPORT,How did you know that?,
32224,SUPPORT,Have we met before?,
32224,SUPPORT,"Even here, people have been talking about you.
Not that the gossip got everything right.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Nah. Even here, people have been talking about you.
Not that the gossip got everything right.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I heard you were beautiful, but obviously that was
an exaggeration.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Oh, Chatterbox. You been looking for me?",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'd prefer not to visit the surface, if I can help it.
I don't wanna run into any knights.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Can't say I'm surprised about Lord Lonato launching
a rebellion.",
32224,SUPPORT,"The writing was on the wall. If anything, it's more
surprising it didn't happen sooner.",
32224,SUPPORT,You seem to know a fair bit about all this.,
32224,SUPPORT,What writing on which wall?,
32224,SUPPORT,"Lord Lonato answers to Count Rowe of Faerghus,
the man who adopted me. That's how I got into the
academy.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm not in contact with the count anymore, but
that's how I know so much.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm not going to waste energy laying it out for you.
Not much point, and you'll understand eventually.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Gaspard territory smacks of war. It'll be interesting
to see how things shake out.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. Haven't seen any suspicious types on the
surface lately, have you? Beefy, mean-looking folks?",
32224,SUPPORT,I have not.,
32224,SUPPORT,I have.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Beautiful. Guess those lowlifes haven't tracked me
down yet.",
32224,SUPPORT,Damn. Guess those lowlifes finally tracked me down.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Bounty hunters are the worst, yeah? They can't just
let me be, so I have to go through the trouble of
roughing 'em up.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Do you have some need of me? I assure you, I am
busier than I may seem.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Oh? You would argue the point? Do you claim to
have a view inside my mind?",
32224,SUPPORT,I don't.,
32224,SUPPORT,"In fact, I do.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Yes, I thought not.",
32224,SUPPORT,I warn you that I don't suffer fools.,
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm doing strenuous mental exercises. My magical
theories require rigorous fine-tuning.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I shall never finish this task if I am not left to my own
devices. Run along, now.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Someone's raising an army in the Kingdom, I heard.
Normally I wouldn't care about that kind of thing...",
32224,SUPPORT,"But this army's picking a fight with the church,
so as far as I'm concerned, more power to 'em.",
32224,SUPPORT,You must really hate the church.,
32224,SUPPORT,You shouldn't say things like that.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Hate's a strong word. I'm just saying, they might
have a good reason to rebel.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hm, good point. Wouldn't want someone on Rhea's
payroll to hear about my trash talk. Mum's the word.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm just saying, they might have a good reason
to rebel.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Rhea and her lackeys like to pretend they're always
in the right, but they're not. No one is.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I've got my ideas about the people after Lady Rhea,
but even I don't know how this'll shake out.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I don't seem very devout, do I? Heh. Even so, I'd
hate to see anything happen to the archibishop.",
32224,SUPPORT,"That secret message is suspicious—to take it at face
value seems...unwise.",
32224,SUPPORT,I hear some thieves are targeting the monastery.,
32224,SUPPORT,"I've been feeling restless lately, so if you want some
help unleashing on those jerks, just say the word.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I been feeling restless lately, so if they wander my
way, I'll do you a solid and clean their clocks.
No charge.",
32224,SUPPORT,I'd appreciate that.,
32224,SUPPORT,You should settle down.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Oooh, this could be fun. Now I've just got to figure
out where they'll be coming from...",
32224,SUPPORT,"What?! You can't expect me to hold back, yeah?
...Oh, I see. You want me to put them on ice first.
Make 'em beg a bit. Heh, I hear ya loud and clear.",
32224,SUPPORT,"My fists are itching for a brawl. Hopefully, I get first
crack at those poor fools...",
32224,SUPPORT,"First the uprising, and now all this talk of an
assassination? What is the world coming to?",
32224,SUPPORT,"I should offer my magical services, just in case.",
32224,SUPPORT,No one asked for that.,
32224,SUPPORT,What kind of services?,
32224,SUPPORT,"Well, that's a fine thing to say! You haven't even
asked what sort of magic I propose!",
32224,SUPPORT,"I've devised a spell to trick flowers into behaving
like guard dogs.",
32224,SUPPORT,"At the first sign of an intruder, the petals burst
open, releasing their pollen! Uhh...I'm...I'm still
fine-tuning it.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Not to be disrespectful, but the Rite of Rebirth seems
kinda silly. What, the goddess is reborn every year?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Although... Hey, if you do run into her, let me know.
I'd like to have a word.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I bet she'll be pretty upset to learn what the church
has been doing in her name.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Miklan? I know that guy. In northern Faerghus, he's
pretty well-known...and not in a good way.",
32224,SUPPORT,"The guy does what he pleases, attacking towns in
Margrave Gautier's territory relentlessly. Stealing
food and even abducting women.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I may be the leader of a bunch of thugs, too, but I'm
nothing like that slime bag.",
32224,SUPPORT,You worry people might compare you?,
32224,SUPPORT,Sounds like you really hate him.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Eh, a bit. I've got folks who follow my lead. But the
similarities end there.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hm, hate's a strong word. It's more that I think I
could lead his bandits in a better way.",
32224,SUPPORT,"A Hero's Relic can turn a slime bag like Miklan into
a knight.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I know you've got one of those shinies yourself, but
don't go doing anything reckless.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're a busy one, aren't ya? Always on the road.
Being a professor seems like a tough gig.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Back when I was first enrolled here, we rarely
traveled. The Battle of the Eagle and Lion was
about it.",
32224,SUPPORT,"This really stirs up the old memories. When I took
part, my house lost. May have been my fault. It's
hard to believe, but I was pretty rash back then.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey... Think I can join in again this year? Bet you
could pull some strings and make it happen, yeah?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Nice sword, Chatterbox. I like how it lights up.
That's a neat trick.",
32224,SUPPORT,"But, now that you have it, the church is gonna want
to use your power for their own ends. Are you gonna
let that happen?",
32224,SUPPORT,I'm not sure.,
32224,SUPPORT,No.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Oh, come on. You can't be so passive.",
32224,SUPPORT,Good. Glad to hear it.,
32224,SUPPORT,"You gotta think for yourself. You're too good to
become one of their stooges.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Looking for Flayn? Some knights came looking a bit
ago too.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I did some of my own hunting but didn't find any
promising leads.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I even had some of my people search for her
throughout the underground...to no avail.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Think about it. The monastery is some thousand
years old.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Who knows how many hidden passageways exist...
She could be here...or anywhere, really.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're looking for someone? Huh. Try asking Yuri.
He's good with stuff like that. I'm better at hitting
things than finding them.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Honestly, I didn't even know Seteth had a sister.",
32224,SUPPORT,"If you figure out where she is and need some muscle,
just holler. We all have our strengths. For me,
my strength IS my strength.",
32224,SUPPORT,"As soon as word spread of Flayn's disappearance,
the knights burst into Abyss.",
32224,SUPPORT,"We tend to be the first suspects when these things
happen, you see.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I suppose it's little surprise when there are shady
characters always coming and going...",
32224,SUPPORT,What kind of scumbag would kidnap poor Flayn?,
32224,SUPPORT,"She must feel so scared and helpless right now.
I hope she's OK...",
32224,SUPPORT,That's kind of you.,
32224,SUPPORT,She might be dead.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Not really. I just know what it's like to be in
that situation.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Wow. I knew you had a cynical side, but that's
just morbid.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I was kidnapped once, y'know... Hopefully we get
her back safely.",
32224,SUPPORT,"The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is almost here.
Time certainly is strange.",
32224,SUPPORT,"All this really has me feeling nostalgic. Back when
I was in the academy, I took part in the battle too.",
32224,SUPPORT,Which class were you in?,
32224,SUPPORT,Did your class win?,
32224,SUPPORT,"The Blue Lions. Back then, I was living with
Kingdom nobility as an adoptee.",
32224,SUPPORT,"We won the battle by a mile. But how we came to
that victory is my little secret.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Lady Rhea still watches the battle, yeah? Best of luck
to you, friend.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. The surface brats have that big brawl this
month, yeah? The Battle of the Eagle and Lion?",
32224,SUPPORT,"The Golden Deer lost that one back in my day.
Hope they win this year!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ha! Got ya! I'll be cheering for your house this time.
Not like I have anything better to do.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. This month is the big brawl, yeah? Yeah!
It's the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!",
32224,SUPPORT,"I hear I'm free to join in. My heart's full to bursting!
My muscles too, but that's pretty normal for me.",
32224,SUPPORT,"This is big, pal. The Legendary King of Grappling's
triumphant return. The other houses won't know
what hit 'em!",
32224,SUPPORT,"That young lady, Monica...might she be Baron
Ochs's daughter?",
32224,SUPPORT,"We're not acquainted, but I have heard tell that
the baron has a daughter roughly her age.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Despite my current circumstances, I was born into
House Nuvelle, one of the preeminent houses of
the Empire. Didn't you know?",
32224,SUPPORT,"There isn't much of my house left to speak of, but
mark my words, someday it shall return in glory!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Speaking of Baron Ochs and those recent goings-on
in the Imperial capital...there's no link there, I trust?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Do you suppose word of her father passing away
has already reached Monica?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Flayn is home safe! Woohoo! I mean, ahem...
Woohoo.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm relieved. I'd be devastated if something had
happened to her.",
32224,SUPPORT,"By the by, do I have to participate in this Eagle and
Lion thing this month?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Gotcha. Well, I hope we win. You won't like what
happens if I'm on the losing team.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I can't shake the feeling that what went down in
Remire Village is something other than a plague.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I guess it's best not to go sticking our noses in it, lest
they get cut off.",
32224,SUPPORT,I can't just ignore what happened.,
32224,SUPPORT,Even though the villagers are in trouble?,
32224,SUPPORT,"Don't go and make me worry about you, friend.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Yeah... I'm definitely worried about them. But I
worry about you getting involved too.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're looking paler than usual. Stop pushing
yourself so hard.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I hear you partied hard after winning the Battle of
the Eagle and Lion. That a fact?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Fighting... Drinking... Damn. Maybe I shoulda
crashed that party.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Truth is I knew you'd win. Counted on it, in fact.
What do I mean by that? Heh, don't worry about it.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Winning the battle was great and all, but the after
party was a complete letdown.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I guess I get it. There were some younger students
around and all that. But still... What a waste.",
32224,SUPPORT,"We needed some fun juice, that's all I'm saying.
But, yeah, it was still a fine time.",
32224,SUPPORT,"News of the affair at Remire Village has reached me.
The situation seems rather dire.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Any threat to the lives of the commonfolk must be
met with swift action.",
32224,SUPPORT,I agree.,
32224,SUPPORT,A commendable position.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah, you share my views? That speaks well of you.
You have more than a commoner's share of integrity.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Though House Nuvelle has fallen, it is still every
noble's duty to provide for the commonfolk.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Given your concern, would it not be appropriate for
you to depart rather than idling the time away?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Chatterbox, what's wrong with you? Go home.",
32224,SUPPORT,I will.,
32224,SUPPORT,That's rude.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Good. No offense, but you look awful.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Sorry, I'm not trying to be mean. I'm just saying,
you look awful.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Get some rest, OK? Sleep is really important when
you're feeling down.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Jeralt raised you, yeah? He was all you had...
You must be feeling a lot right now.",
32224,SUPPORT,"When a parent dies, it really leaves a mark. So feel
what you need to, no matter how that looks.",
32224,SUPPORT,"But know that your inner fire will keep you moving
ahead through even the hardest times.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. I see you're up and at 'em again, yeah?
Good on ya. No use crying over the past and all.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Balthus, have some sensitivity! Who knows what
the poor dear is going through right now?",
32224,SUPPORT,"That ""poor dear"" can hear you, ya know. Talking
about someone like they're not there. How cold
can you get?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah... A fair point. Please, Professor, forgive my
indiscretion. You have my condolences.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Remember, the first step to healing is a hefty dose
of revenge. Get out there and get to it!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey. It seems like you're having a hard time.
Not that I can really understand what you're going
through.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I know that this is painful, but don't lose hope for the
future, OK?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Someday you'll be able to accept what's happened.
And in the meantime, you have plenty of friends here
to support you. Me included.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Things certainly have changed lately. Not that
I mind.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Or perhaps the only thing that's different is how
you look. Or has your personality changed too?",
32224,SUPPORT,I'm more talkative now.,
32224,SUPPORT,I haven't changed.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Heh heh... Well, that's cute. Glad you're able to joke
around, at least. Makes me less concerned about you.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Is that so... You're not a great liar, you know.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Well, whatever the case, I still like you just the same
as I always have.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal, how you holding up? The human body is
strong, but we all have our limits. Even folks who
fraternize with the goddess.",
32224,SUPPORT,"How was she, by the way? A real knockout, yeah?",
32224,SUPPORT,She was unfathomably beautiful.,
32224,SUPPORT,She was a child.,
32224,SUPPORT,"I knew it! Good thing I never officially turned my
back on that beaut, huh? Next punch I throw is for
her!",
32224,SUPPORT,Really?! Huh. That's...a letdown.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Well, in any case, we have our work cut out for us.
No telling what they're planning next...",
32224,SUPPORT,"My word. It seems that the rumors of you receiving
the goddess's power were true.",
32224,SUPPORT,"But you're still you, obviously.",
32224,SUPPORT,Yes. I'm still me.,
32224,SUPPORT,No. I'm a new person.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Good. It would be a shame if you changed into
someone I didn't like.",
32224,SUPPORT,Whatever. You don't seem all that different to me.,
32224,SUPPORT,"It's clear to me, at least, that you are something
more than you were. Something special.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Yeah, yeah. I just hope this newfound specialness
doesn't spell trouble for the rest of us.",
32224,SUPPORT,"So this is how it's turned out. I figured as much,
but I didn't anticipate it would happen so soon.",
32224,SUPPORT,"If Garreg Mach becomes a battlefield, Abyss will
have no choice but to get involved.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Everyone here will have no alternative. They've got
nowhere else to go.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I could smell a war brewing, and sure enough,
here we are.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hmm... If Fódlan falls into chaos, I wonder if my
debts will fall away along with it... Heh, just thinking
aloud here.",
32224,SUPPORT,"If the Empire wants a fight, let's give 'em one
to remember!",
32224,SUPPORT,"It shakes me to my core that the Empire would
lash out so violently.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I shall have to reconsider my intended path towards
restoring House Nuvelle.",
32224,SUPPORT,"The Imperial princess is beyond reason, I take it?
Then I suppose a battle is in the offing.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Still, I could not in good conscience fight without
speaking to her first...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Lots of people in Abyss are already struggling to
get by. War will make things even harder for us.",
32224,SUPPORT,"We're sure to run out of food and other supplies,
and there will probably be refugees to take care of.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Not to mention what might happen if the Empire
takes over and decides to redecorate.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. You're from up top, right?
What business do you have here?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Wait a minute... Ah, got it. You're that new
professor, aren't you? I suppose that means I
have to let you pass.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I guess...welcome to Abyss! This town is full of
rough-and-toughs, so watch your back down here.",
32224,SUPPORT,Hey. What are you lookin' at?,
32224,SUPPORT,I don't want any trouble. Get lost.,
32224,SUPPORT,Such an innocent face you have...,
32224,SUPPORT,This isn't a place for innocent people.,
32224,SUPPORT,Especially not if you're carrying money.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports
need to be reported. And for all reportable things,
I'm your guy.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Oh! Have you explored Abyss, yet? Some shiny
treasures here. Much better than up top. Fact:
treasure likes to be underground.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're one of those treasure snobs who thinks their
treasure is better than everyone else's, are ya?
Those types really get my goat.",
32224,SUPPORT,Mercy! I beg you!,
32224,SUPPORT,"Kostas never meant to attack the church!
He was tricked!",
32224,SUPPORT,"They don't understand that. They'll kill me!
But you... You could let me go! Please!",
32224,SUPPORT,I can't do that.,
32224,SUPPORT,Never hurt anyone again.,
32224,SUPPORT,I...I understand. Then take me to the surface...,
32224,SUPPORT,"I've got a quiet life waiting for me back home.
I'll never cause trouble again, I swear. Thank you!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Despite what my appearance might suggest, I was
actually born a noble.",
32224,SUPPORT,"No one in my generation bore a Crest, however.",
32224,SUPPORT,"When the next generation proved to be flush with
Crests, my father and I were cast aside...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm what you might call the chosen one. The alpha
of Abyss. The reaper and the keeper. That said,
I've had some unnecessary backup recently.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Lord Seteth requested my presence. There's an
important ceremony happening this month.",
32224,SUPPORT,"If only my backup had been a lovely lady with a
thing for watchmen. We could have had a love story
for the ages...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ugh... More church thugs. Can't anybody relax
and have a drink around here?",
32224,SUPPORT,Loosen up. How 'bout a game? You like cards?,
32224,SUPPORT,This god statue speaks to me in a strange voice.,
32224,SUPPORT,"It is a strong voice...but frightening. I wonder what
is on the inside of it.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Actually, if I recall correctly—which is my job and
passion—there were reportable happenings up top as
well. That's why I'm still stuck with Mr. Backup.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm still here by request of Lord Seteth. You can
never be too vigilant.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Truth be told, I'm used to the guy by now. Not Yuri,
though. He shoots him a pointed glare every time he
walks by. Heh. How Yuri is that?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Aelfric used to use his position in the church to look
out for Abyss.",
32224,SUPPORT,He basically set this whole place up for us.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Then some scandal or other forced him out. Got to
wonder what got the church so riled up...",
32224,SUPPORT,"The best fighter in Abyss? Balthus, probably.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Yuri's definitely the most cunning. Constance is the
strongest with magic.",
32224,SUPPORT,"The most dangerous of them all though? Hapi.
You've heard the rumors, haven't you?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Someone's gone missing up top. And guess what.
Because of that...this backup guy... Is. Still. Here.
Ugh! Can't catch a break, can I?",
32224,SUPPORT,"The investigation may be over, but I thought it best
to stay by your side a bit longer.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You hear that? Mr. Backup is here voluntarily.
I guess that's OK... He's actually not so bad.",
32224,SUPPORT,"First the knights, then some monk, now a teacher?
Church setting up a punchline for a joke, or what?",
32224,SUPPORT,Monk?,
32224,SUPPORT,Teacher?,
32224,SUPPORT,Some old guy with a staff or something. Big deal.,
32224,SUPPORT,"You, genius. You're a teacher, aren't you?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Did you see the man with the sickle? He looked like
death itself.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I saw him at the end of the road, but he stepped
around a corner and out of sight.",
32224,SUPPORT,I think he used some kind of secret passage...,
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're wondering where Mr. Backup is, aren't you?
Figured you'd want an update. Or report, if you will.
He's gone. Other duties or some such nonsense.",
32224,SUPPORT,"But he'll be back, right? I bet so... I think he liked
this place? Especially the company... We really had
something... Hm, he'll miss it. Just you wait and see.",
32224,SUPPORT,"When the nobles came for me, they were completely
without mercy. They... They killed everyone.",
32224,SUPPORT,"My parents. My husband. My son. They all died...
for nothing. For being in the way.",
32224,SUPPORT,"People with Crests do whatever they want. No one
even tries to stop them. Especially not the church...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, come join me over here. For once, we've got
plenty of food! Hahaha!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Folks up above caught so many fish that we've got
a bunch more down here than usual.",
32224,SUPPORT,"It's not too common to get a big fishing haul down
here in Abyss!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Mr. Backup doesn't come by anymore—which is fine.
Not incredibly rude or anything. Nope. Juuuust fine.",
32224,SUPPORT,Have you ever killed anyone?,
32224,SUPPORT,Yes.,
32224,SUPPORT,No.,
32224,SUPPORT,"But only bad people, right?",
32224,SUPPORT,Really? Never? Is that true?,
32224,SUPPORT,...,
32224,SUPPORT,Correct.,
32224,SUPPORT,Actually...,
32224,SUPPORT,"You look scary, but you're actually not so bad...",
32224,SUPPORT,What?! Seriously?!,
32224,SUPPORT,"Wanna get your hands on something valuable that
you can't get on the surface?",
32224,SUPPORT,"No, thank you.",
32224,SUPPORT,What is it?,
32224,SUPPORT,Fine. Doubt you could afford it anyway.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Money first, friend. How much you got? Ah... No,
let me stop you there. That won't be enough.",
32224,SUPPORT,Maybe next time. See you around.,
32224,SUPPORT,Want to help me out with my magical research?,
32224,SUPPORT,I just need to open you up and have a look inside...,
32224,SUPPORT,"No? Huh, well... Would you lend me a few hairs
at least?",
32224,SUPPORT,"When I snuck into the monastery a while back, I saw
a girl there the same age as me.",
32224,SUPPORT,She was crying. I couldn't believe it.,
32224,SUPPORT,"How could you ever cry in a place like that,
where there's always food on the table?",
32224,SUPPORT,"They're having a lot of fun up on the surface, aren't
they? Some kinda grand ball...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Picture them all relaxing, having a drink...
Getting to dance with people they fancy...",
32224,SUPPORT,"If I showed my face up there, the knights would have
my head in a second.",
32224,SUPPORT,"This is our last occasion to speak. I am ordered
to be leaving.",
32224,SUPPORT,"They are thinking I am the follower of an evil god.
It is not so, but they are not understanding.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"But maybe now isn't the time? You seem down.
Got something on your mind?",
32224,SUPPORT,"I hope you know I'm here for you, if you ever have
your own stuff to report. That's what friends are for.
Unless it's about money. In which case...I'm busy.",
32224,SUPPORT,"This month feels different, doesn't it? Garreg Mach's
all...tense. Like the whole place might explode.",
32224,SUPPORT,This is why I've kept to myself all these years.,
32224,SUPPORT,"I don't wanna be anywhere near whatever's about
to happen.",
32224,SUPPORT,Captain Jeralt's been killed?! I can't believe it...,
32224,SUPPORT,"From all I'd heard about the man... I thought he
was indestructible.",
32224,SUPPORT,"He was so strong. What could have possibly—
Forgive me, I shouldn't speculate.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You look different. And you're acting different.
You're just all around...different! Shaking things
up, are we?",
32224,SUPPORT,"I think that's great. Gotta keep things interesting,
right? For what it's worth...it's a good look, and you
wear it well!",
32224,SUPPORT,Look at you!,
32224,SUPPORT,"Listen, all sorts of folks wind up in this place for all
sorts of reasons. Nobody's judging.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Whatever happened to you doesn't make one bit
of difference to any of these people.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Got a shady offer from somebody well-dressed.
Noble's lapdog, probably.",
32224,SUPPORT,"There was a big sack of coin on offer, but not a lot
of real info about the job.",
32224,SUPPORT,"It seemed suspicious, so I turned it down. Now I
wonder if that was a mistake...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Aww, guess who was worried about Abyss and came
by to check on me. I mean, on us. Isn't that nice?
That's just...so nice.",
32224,SUPPORT,"My pleasure. Surely the church can spare one knight
to help you watch over this place.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I'm not crying! I'm just...just don't worry about it,
OK?! Move it along!",
32224,SUPPORT,"War's actually coming, isn't it? Unbelievable.",
32224,SUPPORT,Imperial troops in Garreg Mach? It's gonna be wild.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Whatever happens won't affect us down here in
Abyss, though... Will it?",
32224,SUPPORT,This might be our last chance to get out of here.,
32224,SUPPORT,I'm leaving Garreg Mach. You should too.,
32224,SUPPORT,"Protect the students? Have you got a death wish?!
All right, all right. Uh, take this...and try not to
get killed.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Whoever you are, it doesn't matter much to me.
But I do advise getting out of here before you get
tangled up in trouble.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Unless you've been sent here under someone's
orders. In which case, I'll happily show you a good
time. Heh heh...",
32224,SUPPORT,"Hmmm. You're that mercenary turned professor,
aren't you? The one who showed up at the monastery
kinda recently.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Yeah, you're the one I've heard so much about.
Well, I guess it's fine you're here, then.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You can call me Yuri. You'll want to remember that,
if you ever come down here again.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Haven't seen your face before. You're clearly not
from around here.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Ah, you're that new teacher everyone's been yapping
about. And yet...you look younger than me. Weird.",
32224,SUPPORT,The name's Balthus. Formerly of the Alliance.,
32224,SUPPORT,"And who might you be? Not an Abyssian, that much
is clear at a glance.",
32224,SUPPORT,"A visitor from above, perhaps? With what purpose?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Oh...but of course. You must be the new teacher
specially appointed by Lady Rhea. That is it, yes?",
32224,SUPPORT,"Rumors have been flying underground about you.
Well, then! I am Constance von Nuvelle.",
32224,SUPPORT,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Ahaha!",
32224,SUPPORT,"Who are you? Wait, shut up, let me guess.",
32224,SUPPORT,"You're...that new professor, right? You just started
teaching up on the surface.",
32224,SUPPORT,"Even here, people have been talking about you.
Not that the gossip got everything right.",
32224,SUPPORT,"I heard you were beautiful, but obviously that was
an exaggeration.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Surprised that I'm here, are you? I know a winning
side when I see it.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I mean, there's no way I'd risk my neck and my
people by willfully joining a losing battle.",
32225,SUPPORT,You really care for them.,
32225,SUPPORT,Do you feel you chose wisely?,
32225,SUPPORT,"I do. We'll see how this all shakes out. All depends
on how we—and you—fight.",
32225,SUPPORT,"You'd better hope I did, otherwise we're both dead.
*laughs* ",
32225,SUPPORT,"Regardless of who comes after us—even if it's the
knights—we've got you on our side, so it'll all
be fine.",
32225,SUPPORT,"What's the deal, pal? You don't want me here?
Come on, have a heart. This side is where all the
action is.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Look... I'll level with you. I want to help that
Edelgard gal achieve her goal. I mean it.",
32225,SUPPORT,"If Her Majesty gets what she's after,
my mother will...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Eh, forget it. Now's not the time. We've got to keep
our heads in the game so we can win, yeah?",
32225,SUPPORT,"Having Yuri on our side will help things. He's not
someone you want as an enemy.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I knew nothing of Lady Edelgard's past, or of her
innermost feelings...",
32225,SUPPORT,But I know now. I persuaded her to tell all.,
32225,SUPPORT,"It would have been rude to hound her relentlessly
until she revealed herself, yes?",
32225,SUPPORT,"Then...that's certainly not what I did.
*laugh*",
32225,SUPPORT,"With the Empire taking over Garreg Mach, I wonder
what will happen to Abyss.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Some people have spent their whole lives there.
For their sake, I hope Abyss doesn't get trampled
into ruin.",
32225,SUPPORT,I can't guarantee anything.,
32225,SUPPORT,I promise to protect them.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Yeah. I guess all I can do is talk about it with Eddy...
I mean, Her Majesty.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Thanks. You should try talking about it with Eddy...
I mean, Her Majesty. She might listen to you.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Also, this is less important, but if somebody trashes
my room, I'm gonna be mad.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Huh... Is that... It is you, isn't it? I kinda forgot what
you looked like.",
32225,SUPPORT,You've changed too.,
32225,SUPPORT,Ouch...,
32225,SUPPORT,"No doubt. A lot can happen in five years. A baby
goes from crawling and babbling to walking and
talking in that time.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Aw, I didn't mean any harm. It's just that so much
has happened... It's hard to keep track, you know?",
32225,SUPPORT,"Anyway, you came back, and that's what matters.
Staying here wasn't a mistake. I can say that much.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal. You've got a lot of nerve coming here after
ignoring us for five years!",
32225,SUPPORT,...,
32225,SUPPORT,"Ha! Got ya! All this time, and you still can't take a
joke, can ya?",
32225,SUPPORT,"Good job surviving and clawing your way back to us.
This day couldn't get better if it tried.",
32225,SUPPORT,It's nice to see you too.,
32225,SUPPORT,I didn't expect such a warm reception.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Heh. Say, now that you're back, we should celebrate
with some liquid gold. We're not your students
anymore, so it should be fine, yeah?",
32225,SUPPORT,"Oh... I like this idea. We'll make it a wild party!
Even the emperor won't be able to turn it down.",
32225,SUPPORT,"If you haven't heard, we'll soon be launching
a full-scale assault on the Alliance.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Her Majesty has searched relentlessly for you.
Now that you're found, her moment has come.",
32225,SUPPORT,Really? She looked that intensely?,
32225,SUPPORT,She didn't just happen upon me?,
32225,SUPPORT,"Yes. Before then, I had never known her to show
such...desperate resolve.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I think not. You were, it sounded to me, crucial to
her plans.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The stalemate we've been locked in shall give way
very abruptly.",
32225,SUPPORT,We have your reappearance to thank for that.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Abyss is OK. The Bert kept it safe out of the
goodness of his heart. Ha. Kidding, of course.",
32225,SUPPORT,"He said the ""lowlifes"" here could be useful, because
they won't mind fighting dirty, or rooting out spies.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Or...something along those lines. I didn't pay much
attention to that part.",
32225,SUPPORT,You haven't changed much since I left.,
32225,SUPPORT,Aren't you glad I'm back?,
32225,SUPPORT,"Yeah. Honestly, I'm psyched that you're back. It's all
I can do to stop myself from whooping with joy.",
32225,SUPPORT,"You don't know the half of it. It's all I can do to stop
myself from whooping with joy.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Ugh! What more could Hubert possibly want
from me?",
32225,SUPPORT,What did he do?,
32225,SUPPORT,You seem tired...,
32225,SUPPORT,"He's been pushing me too damn hard. Said that the
only way to win over the Alliance lords is with
my help.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Well, yeah, clearly. I haven't been worked this hard
in ages...",
32225,SUPPORT,"All grousing aside, it's not the end of the world. If it
helps us win, I'll do whatever it takes.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I wouldn't have signed up for this if I wasn't getting
something out of it.",
32225,SUPPORT,Ahaha! The Great Bridge of Myrddin is ours.,
32225,SUPPORT,"The Alliance may be composed of powerful nobles,
but their power is directionless and thus wasted.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Though the Empire was no better before Lady
Edelgard ascended the throne.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Indeed, my own house fell due in part to its inability
to wield power properly...",
32225,SUPPORT,"You know, I've always wanted to see the world.
That's why I left my village.",
32225,SUPPORT,"And here I am, traveling to all these interesting new
places...to kill people. Not what I had in mind.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'll find some time to admire the scenery.
Though people might get mad I'm not taking this
silly war seriously...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Oops, that was close. Almost sighed.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I'm impressed by how quickly toppling Derdriu
brought the Alliance into the fold.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Ideally we'd crush the Kingdom with ease...but
something tells me it'll be...complicated.",
32225,SUPPORT,"You'd better sharpen your focus to a fine point.
Though I'm sure you already know that.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The Alliance may be finished, but House Albrecht
managed to come out unscathed.",
32225,SUPPORT,"It's all thanks to my little bro. He's a great guy.
I'm sure he'll do well under the Empire.",
32225,SUPPORT,That's good to hear.,
32225,SUPPORT,Will you go back there now?,
32225,SUPPORT,"No kidding. I may have cut ties with them, but I was
still curious to know how they were managing.",
32225,SUPPORT,Not a chance. I don't have time for drama like that.,
32225,SUPPORT,"The world may have changed, but I haven't. I have
no interest in playing the noble game. I'd rather just
keep doing my thing.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The swiftness of the Alliance's withdrawal on seeing
that they had no hope of victory was unsurprising.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Given their complete lack of solidarity, there could
really have been no other outcome.",
32225,SUPPORT,Do you have a problem with the Alliance nobles?,
32225,SUPPORT,Wasn't their withdrawal Claude's idea?,
32225,SUPPORT,"No. But a noble's duty is to protect the commonfolk
of their territory. I judge the Alliance by that metric.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Yes, he built his scheme with their self-interest as its
cornerstone. Very cunning of him.",
32225,SUPPORT,"What's important is that one of the forces arrayed
against us has fallen. Our victory draws nearer!",
32225,SUPPORT,"We're fighting people we used to know from the
Officers Academy.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Guess that's the kind of thing that happens in war,
but...still. It's pretty twisted.",
32225,SUPPORT,"It makes me feel so... Oof. Maybe I'll just try not to
think about it.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The church smiles warmly on all who pay reverence,
but defy them, and... Well, that's another story.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The way the Knights of Seiros fight is cold-blooded
and ruthless. Coming from me, you get the
implications.",
32225,SUPPORT,Is everyone in Abyss OK?,
32225,SUPPORT,I'm glad we did it.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Yeah, somehow. There are no good ways out of here,
so we're lucky they never came through.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Yeah... Although it was a draw, I'm relieved it ended
without the monastery being captured.",
32225,SUPPORT,"So, Arianrhod next, huh? I've got some fond
memories of that place.",
32225,SUPPORT,"So about this surprise attack. It's all over if the details
leak, yeah? I know my shoulders are broad, but you
sure you wanna lay a secret like that on 'em?",
32225,SUPPORT,"I'm no war hero. In fact, I'm a wanted man. If I were
you, I wouldn't trust me with something that
important...",
32225,SUPPORT,"She trusts you, and so do I.",
32225,SUPPORT,...You're still a wanted man?,
32225,SUPPORT,"Wait a minute. By ""she,"" do you mean Edelgard?
Ha! I didn't know she had eyes for me.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Huh. I just got a sudden chill, like someone's got it
out for me. It's not you, is it? Nah... You wouldn't.
Your shoes are too goody.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hard to say, but the bounty hunters have been off my
back lately. Maybe my debts are finally forgotten...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Fhirdiad at last... The very city where I struggled
through school and mastered the art of spellcraft!",
32225,SUPPORT,"So many memories are bound up there, and now it is
to become a battlefield... I am a bit overwhelmed.",
32225,SUPPORT,We're not actually attacking it yet.,
32225,SUPPORT,"With that acting talent, you should be on stage.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Yes, but don't you know there are spies everywhere?
Learn to take your cue!",
32225,SUPPORT,"Aha, I...I am quite the thespian, it's true. You, on
the other hand, need to learn your cue.",
32225,SUPPORT,"To fool the enemy, one must first deceive one's
allies. The walls have ears, you know.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The Bert said that we'll be facing someone I know in
our next battle.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The lady who captured me after I ran away from my
village. I wonder if she remembers me...",
32225,SUPPORT,Do you want to confront her?,
32225,SUPPORT,Do you want to talk to her?,
32225,SUPPORT,"Honestly, I don't wanna go anywhere near her.
But if I have to, it won't be much different than
any other fight.",
32225,SUPPORT,"That's how it goes, right? If we wanna end this war,
we have to keep charging forward, no matter who's
on the other side.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Seems like a lot of people from House Rowe died
in Arianrhod...",
32225,SUPPORT,"I know Edelgard is saying it's the church's fault, and
she hasn't been shy to express that. But...that doesn't
seem right to me.",
32225,SUPPORT,Yeah...,
32225,SUPPORT,"If not the church, then who?",
32225,SUPPORT,"My take? There exist some dangerous folks capable
of destroying strongholds with ease...",
32225,SUPPORT,"You should ask Edelgard or Hubert. They'd know
more than I do.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Some think that all we have to do is take down
Fhirdiad to end the war, but I don't think it's quite
that simple.",
32225,SUPPORT,"So it's finally time to take on Fhirdiad. Can't wait to
get in there and show 'em what I'm made of!",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hopefully I get a go at that Dimitri guy before all is
said and done...",
32225,SUPPORT,Why would you want that?,
32225,SUPPORT,What an odd thing to hope for...,
32225,SUPPORT,"They say he has inhuman strength, yeah? Best way to
find out is to throw fists with the guy.",
32225,SUPPORT,"It's war, pal. If you can't be blunt on the battlefield,
what are we even fighting for?",
32225,SUPPORT,"He may be the Tempest King of Fhirdiad, but I'm
the Grappling King of the world! My domain is
way bigger.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Grab a front-row seat if you can manage. These arms
of mine will knock some sense back into that
towhead of his.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The war of Fódlan unification is finally reaching
its climax!",
32225,SUPPORT,"I must surpass myself in the struggle to come if
Her Majesty is to recognize my power.",
32225,SUPPORT,"You must send me into the field, that I might achieve
greatness in full view of Her Majesty!",
32225,SUPPORT,Let's go for it together.,
32225,SUPPORT,Go for it.,
32225,SUPPORT,"But don't you see? Your presence would diminish
the grandeur of my achievements!",
32225,SUPPORT,"I intend to. The fate of House Nuvelle hangs in
the balance!",
32225,SUPPORT,"The culmination of all my studies, all my magical
experiments, shall be unleashed in battle!",
32225,SUPPORT,"If we win this next battle, it won't just be a victory
against the Kingdom, but also the church.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Maybe they'll all die—even the people from the
church who lied to me and locked me up.",
32225,SUPPORT,Would that bother you?,
32225,SUPPORT,Is that what you want?,
32225,SUPPORT,"I don't care either way. If they died, I would say,
""Well, that happened,"" and move on.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I don't owe them my compassion. They've never
shown me any.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32225,SUPPORT,"It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years,
hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard.",
32225,SUPPORT,"That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in
and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The Imperial army hasn't interfered with us all that
much, so it's business as usual here in Abyss. I mean,
as usual as it gets here, anyhow.",
32225,SUPPORT,A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started.,
32225,SUPPORT,"People are saying it was the church that used to keep
order around here.",
32225,SUPPORT,But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.,
32225,SUPPORT,"I used to be a rather important person in the church,
but...I am in exile for committing a crime.",
32225,SUPPORT,I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed!,
32225,SUPPORT,"My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church
wasn't putting in enough to rebuild...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I hear Derdriu is our next objective. Small world.
That's actually where I grew up. It's a great place...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hello, Professor. I doubt you recognize me, but I
work for Lord Hubert.",
32225,SUPPORT,"He has stationed me here to ensure that the church
does not attempt to make use of this place.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Thus, I'm blending in with the residents here.
Strictly confidentially, of course.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter
down here—nowhere else to go.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their
strongest people to this fight.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The army runs you ragged. Marches you from place
to place, prodding you to fight.",
32225,SUPPORT,"They promised me three meals a day... They'd have
to give a lot more than that to get me to sign on.",
32225,SUPPORT,I'd rather starve down here than deal with that.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The Alliance is a thing of the past now. Times are
changing fast these days. It's hard to keep up, even
for me!",
32225,SUPPORT,"I wonder if Abyss is on the verge of change too.
Change leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty leads
to...change? I dunno. I'm just a guard.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as
many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?",
32225,SUPPORT,No. The men aren't as few as that.,
32225,SUPPORT,Yes. Easily twice as many women.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something.",
32225,SUPPORT,No way. You got eyes? Take a look around.,
32225,SUPPORT,"Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here.
I'm in hiding from the army.",
32225,SUPPORT,"I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get
away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Justice, ambition—what does any of that matter if
you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?",
32225,SUPPORT,...,
32225,SUPPORT,That damn prince. Seems my role here is at an end.,
32225,SUPPORT,"No matter. Should another chance present itself,
I'll take a less subtle route...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32225,SUPPORT,"As you know, I'm the anointed alpha of Abyss.
But this lady's been standing watch for a while.
She can probably hear us talking even now...",
32225,SUPPORT,"Yes, I can. I'm here by order of Lord Hubert.
That is all I'm at liberty to reveal at present.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Wow. Impressive. You've really got a knack for this,
lady. Ever think of making this a full-time gig?
I could use the company... I mean, the backup.",
32225,SUPPORT,"My mission concludes at the end of the month.
Deepest apologies.",
32225,SUPPORT,"My friend and I were messing around the other day,
and an Imperial general stopped to talk to us.",
32225,SUPPORT,"""If you've got that much energy,"" he said, ""you
should fight for the Imperial army!""",
32225,SUPPORT,"Honestly, maybe we should think about it...",
32225,SUPPORT,What a pain. What an absolute pain...,
32225,SUPPORT,What's the matter?,
32225,SUPPORT,...,
32225,SUPPORT,"Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Here's a word of warning—if anyone here asks you
for a favor, it's probably just a scam.",
32225,SUPPORT,...,
32225,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32225,SUPPORT,"The war is careening headfirst toward its grand
finale. Do me a favor and get through this mess
alive, OK?",
32225,SUPPORT,"After the dust settles, maybe I'll go on to guard
other entrances in other parts of the world. I'm a
dreamer, my friend. Always have been.",
32225,SUPPORT,"Word is Garreg Mach's starting to look like a real
town again.",
32225,SUPPORT,"With the Empire winning one battle after another,
it seems like the end to the war is finally in sight.",
32225,SUPPORT,There's hope for recovery now. Even for Abyss.,
32225,SUPPORT,"I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there
recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff.",
32225,SUPPORT,"There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five
years on... It's just a fact of life.",
32225,SUPPORT,"What? There have been lots of battles on the surface
recently? I hadn't heard! See what I mean?!",
32226,SUPPORT,"Well, hello. It's been a while, hasn't it? Are you really
so surprised to see me here?",
32226,SUPPORT,"I flew here just as soon as I heard you were alive.
I care more than you may realize.",
32226,SUPPORT,I'm happy you came.,
32226,SUPPORT,There's much to be done. Let's work together.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does make
my heart flutter a bit.",
32226,SUPPORT,Yes. Let's.,
32226,SUPPORT,"So long as our efforts are aligned, I'll happily work
alongside you.",
32226,SUPPORT,"These past five years have been so chaotic, even the
bounty hunters backed off. I kinda miss the chase.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I don't have family ties worth fighting for, so these
muscles are up for grabs. Use me as you see fit, pal.",
32226,SUPPORT,I'm counting on you.,
32226,SUPPORT,I'm not sure about your motivation...,
32226,SUPPORT,"You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and
I'll smash it up for ya.",
32226,SUPPORT,"By that, you mean, ""Thank you, Magnanimous King
of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome.",
32226,SUPPORT,"If you're worried my skills have dulled from disuse,
think again. I've been fighting thieves to stay sharp.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! You have the look of someone relieved
to see me.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Before you ask, yes. My superior spellcraft is yours.
It's your reward for waiting so patiently for me.",
32226,SUPPORT,Are you sure?,
32226,SUPPORT,It would help me a lot.,
32226,SUPPORT,"I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough.
I recommend that you accept my generous offer.",
32226,SUPPORT,Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying.,
32226,SUPPORT,"But my assistance has a price. I expect you to aid me
in fulfilling my dream of restoring House Nuvelle.",
32226,SUPPORT,"You're back, finally! I've been waiting for so long.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I thought you might have died. But I didn't have
anywhere else to go, so...I stayed here.",
32226,SUPPORT,Sorry to keep you waiting.,
32226,SUPPORT,Thanks for sticking around.,
32226,SUPPORT,I'll think about forgiving you.,
32226,SUPPORT,You're welcome. It wasn't easy.,
32226,SUPPORT,"I've been kinda lonely. As you might have noticed,
we've lost a few people down here.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The Valley of Torment, huh? I see your angle, but
don't let your guard down.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Any movement about their borders, and the lords of
the Kingdom will react swiftly. Don't underestimate
them.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Keep your focus on a positive outcome. There's a lot
to gain and a lot to lose.",
32226,SUPPORT,"So Judith is on our side now. That right?
Haven't seen that lady in years.",
32226,SUPPORT,"These days, people call her a hero. Back then, I just
called her a catch and a half.",
32226,SUPPORT,How long ago did you know her?,
32226,SUPPORT,"You two weren't...friends, were you?",
32226,SUPPORT,"Quite a while. I was a kid back then, but she caught
my eye when she came to one of the Alliance dances.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Ha! If only. Nah, I was a kid at the time, but she still
managed to catch my eye.",
32226,SUPPORT,"She was the second loveliest lady in all of Fódlan.
Who's the first, you ask? Heh, that's my little secret...",
32226,SUPPORT,"So you intend to march into Ailell. Frankly,
I want no part of it.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Surely, such an uneventful journey won't require
my presence.",
32226,SUPPORT,So you're staying here?,
32226,SUPPORT,I'll need you with us.,
32226,SUPPORT,And miss my share of the glory? Unacceptable.,
32226,SUPPORT,You will? Then...I shall don my marching boots.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Though I would ask that we at least consider
marching only under cover of night.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The Valley of Torment... Isn't that the place where
it's scorching hot year-round?",
32226,SUPPORT,"You know, I've always wanted to see the world.
That's why I left my village.",
32226,SUPPORT,"And here I am, traveling to all these interesting new
places...to kill people. Not what I had in mind.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'll find some time to admire the scenery.
Though people might get mad I'm not taking this
silly war seriously...",
32226,SUPPORT,"Oops, that was close. Almost sighed.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Damn, who'd have thought that House Rowe would
show up.",
32226,SUPPORT,"They must've been sweating blood to get to Ailell
from way out there.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Guess it's been a while since I left House Rowe, so it
doesn't bother me much to have to fight them.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Kinda always knew I'd be the one to take that
stubborn old donkey out. I've been ready for this.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Huh. That lady hasn't changed a bit since I was
a kid. Still intimidating as hell. What a woman.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Being me, I'm not nervous or anything. I just...
I'm not sure how to approach her, that's all.",
32226,SUPPORT,"My luck, she'll treat me like I'm still a kid, even
though I'm clearly a full-grown adult man.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Hm. If that's the angle she takes, maybe I can get
some nice hugs out of this... Huh?! Oh, nothing.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Invading the Empire at last, are we? I cannot still
the wild palpitations in my chest.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I have made myself ready to the extent that I could,
but now that the day draws near...",
32226,SUPPORT,"I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of
restoring the Imperial house of Nuvelle.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Which leaves me with no choice but to appeal to
you and Claude for that. My dream is in your hands.",
32226,SUPPORT,I've never met someone like Judy.,
32226,SUPPORT,"She's easygoing, but at the same time, tough as nails.
I bet she'd be real fun to hang out with.",
32226,SUPPORT,I like her too.,
32226,SUPPORT,She scares me a little.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know?",
32226,SUPPORT,"Judy's great. Unlike that other guy,
Lord What's-His-Name.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I can't stand people like him—people who think
they're always in the right.",
32226,SUPPORT,"All he did was make trouble, but he convinced
himself it was for a good cause. So infuriating.",
32226,SUPPORT,"If the Empire rallies its forces and attacks Garreg
Mach, I'm not so sure Abyss will be OK...",
32226,SUPPORT,"If we're not careful, it'll end up buried in rubble.",
32226,SUPPORT,You really think so?,
32226,SUPPORT,I won't let that happen.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Like I said, only if we're not careful. If it comes down
to it, I'll protect this place till my dying breath.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Heh heh... Ever the valiant one. But nobody ever
knows how a war will turn out. That's part of the
deal, you know?",
32226,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I want to ensure
there is still a refuge for people to escape to.",
32226,SUPPORT,"You know, House Albrecht also took part in the
Battle of Gronder. That's where my little bro is
of course...",
32226,SUPPORT,"He's very different from me. A smart one, but just
about worthless in a fight.",
32226,SUPPORT,I really hope he's OK...,
32226,SUPPORT,"It's not that I don't sympathize with Lady Edelgard's
goals, mind you.",
32226,SUPPORT,"But perhaps not to the point of shedding blood for
her ideals.",
32226,SUPPORT,Perhaps not.,
32226,SUPPORT,Some ideals are worth fighting for.,
32226,SUPPORT,"I must keep her example in mind as I chart
a new path.",
32226,SUPPORT,Of course. But I've gone down a different road.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Peace in Fódlan and a restored House Nuvelle
shall be my guiding star as I blaze my own trail!",
32226,SUPPORT,"People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and
nobles clashing over territory. Things like that.",
32226,SUPPORT,"So before the war, when folks talked about how
peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent
are you living on?""",
32226,SUPPORT,"I get it now. A few isolated skirmishes here and there
are nothing compared to a full-blown war.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The one truly peaceful place I've known was the
village where I grew up.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Feels like a death wish, attacking the Imperial capital
like this.",
32226,SUPPORT,"You don't really think we're going to beat the
Empire with these paltry forces, do you?",
32226,SUPPORT,I do.,
32226,SUPPORT,I don't know...,
32226,SUPPORT,"Heh heh! Is that so? Oh, how I love your resolve.",
32226,SUPPORT,"You've chosen your path...now own it. If you can't
stand up to me, you certainly can't stand up to
the Empire.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Is it true what they say? That the archbishop is a
captive of the Empire?",
32226,SUPPORT,"I've never heard of anything so brash in all the
Empire's long history.",
32226,SUPPORT,"It is vexing that Lady Edelgard's true motives elude
me. If only I still had noble connections to draw on...",
32226,SUPPORT,"The loss of my house has proven to be a thorn in my
side again and again.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The Kingdom and the Alliance both came out of the
last fight looking battered and broken.",
32226,SUPPORT,"If the Empire is wiped out too, then who's left to run
the joint?",
32226,SUPPORT,"I guess the next leader of Fódlan could be...you.
I'd be pretty psyched about that.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Slithering in darkness. Unsettling to say the least.
You must be boiling to avenge your father though.",
32226,SUPPORT,Absolutely.,
32226,SUPPORT,"It's not like that, exactly.",
32226,SUPPORT,"You seem pretty calm for what it is we're staring at.
Where's your fire, huh?",
32226,SUPPORT,"I've gotta say, I wish you were a little more fiery
about all this.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Though, I suppose a lot of time has passed since your
father died.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I imagine this battle will be a defining moment in
history. All or nothing. Let's do this.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I thought defeating the Empire would be the end of
it, but now we're after some mysterious shadow
organization? For crying out loud...",
32226,SUPPORT,"If that's what it takes to achieve peace, count me and
my muscles in.",
32226,SUPPORT,"This might be my last chance to literally save the
world with my strength. Not gonna let that pass
me by.",
32226,SUPPORT,Whatever threatens Fódlan also threatens my dream.,
32226,SUPPORT,This folly must end now!,
32226,SUPPORT,Aren't you scared?,
32226,SUPPORT,Do you think we have a chance?,
32226,SUPPORT,"Fear is not a consideration of mine. I do what must
be done and always have.",
32226,SUPPORT,"You go to war harboring such doubts? Pray keep
these fainthearted ruminations to yourself!",
32226,SUPPORT,"What is frightening is to have scant idea of what is
in store. Now that we know, victory shall be ours.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Sounds like there were shenanigans happening
behind the scenes in the Empire.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I think war was basically inevitable no matter what
Eddy did, with those creeps pulling the strings.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Come to think of it, I wonder if the lady who
kidnapped me was...",
32226,SUPPORT,Never mind. Not worth mentioning.,
32226,SUPPORT,"The war's over...for now. We need to think ahead
to our next steps.",
32226,SUPPORT,"And here you are, the new chosen leader of the land.
Though, judging by your expression, you don't seem
too enthused.",
32226,SUPPORT,Do you think I'm suited to it?,
32226,SUPPORT,"Please take my place, Yuri.",
32226,SUPPORT,"It's hard to say how a region under your rule may
turn out. But it'll be interesting to watch it unfold.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Heh heh! Very funny. You know elevating the lord
of the underground to such rulership wouldn't
exactly be well received.",
32226,SUPPORT,"If you end up on the throne, do me a favor and take
care of the people of Abyss. I'd like to spread my
wings and fly away someday.",
32226,SUPPORT,"War is over, pal. It's time to relax! Grab some drinks
and let loose!",
32226,SUPPORT,"Nothing makes a drink taste better than sharing it
with a buddy who's fought at your side. Throw in
some war stories, and you've got yourself a party.",
32226,SUPPORT,I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.,
32226,SUPPORT,All in moderation...,
32226,SUPPORT,"That's it? Come on, lighten up and join in! Plenty of
good times to go around.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Worried about me, are ya? Heh, should've known
this would happen. I'm lovable to a fault.",
32226,SUPPORT,"If you're not gonna have a drink with me, the least
you can do is help me find a lucky lady to keep me
company in your stead...",
32226,SUPPORT,"I was planning to ask some lovely lady to join me,
but... Well, let's be honest. Who's more deserving
of me than you?",
32226,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! Thanks to my tireless efforts, the war is
at an end.",
32226,SUPPORT,"But the work of achieving my dream has only begun!
House Nuvelle's name shall ring out once more!",
32226,SUPPORT,I can't wait to see it happen.,
32226,SUPPORT,What's your plan?,
32226,SUPPORT,"With my genius for spellcraft, you shan't be
waiting long.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I'll leverage my genius for spellcraft to restore
House Nuvelle's prestige, of course.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I'm already deep into several promising avenues
of research. Hm-hm-hm!",
32226,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32226,SUPPORT,"It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years,
hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard.",
32226,SUPPORT,"That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in
and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Looks like the Knights of Seiros have returned.
I wonder if Mr. Backup is back too...",
32226,SUPPORT,A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started.,
32226,SUPPORT,"People are saying it was the church that used to keep
order around here.",
32226,SUPPORT,But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Remember that battle five years ago? Oh... Um,
I'm guessing you do. Anyway, remember that knight
who watched over Abyss with me for a while?",
32226,SUPPORT,"He said he was going to check on things up top but
that he'd return. Thing is...I haven't seen him since.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Lots of knights have returned, but not him. I hope
he's safe...",
32226,SUPPORT,"You're alive? I was sure that the fall of Garreg Mach
had claimed your life...",
32226,SUPPORT,"I left for the Kingdom initially, but my reading of
the stars spelled disaster, so I turned back.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I've spent most of the past five years drifting through
Alliance territory. I've only recently returned.",
32226,SUPPORT,"When the monastery fell to ruin, we lost all hope
for support from the church.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Most able-bodied folks abandoned Abyss for the
surface around that time.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Since then, we've been barely scraping by...",
32226,SUPPORT,"Bandits from Garreg Mach used to come down to
Abyss pretty frequently.",
32226,SUPPORT,"We never dealt with them though. We refused their
offers at every turn. Sometimes we had to use force.",
32226,SUPPORT,"It was Hapi who finally drove them out for good.
Only then there were beasts all over the place...",
32226,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports
need to be reported. And for all reportable things,
I'm your guy.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Not sure what brought people back up above,
but I'm glad for it.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The dining hall, the greenhouse... They're all ripe
for the picking again.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Uh, I mean, for them! Good for them!",
32226,SUPPORT,"House Daphnel was kind enough to share their food
with us.",
32226,SUPPORT,"It may not be much in the grand scheme of things,
but the gesture means a lot.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The Hero of Daphnel is something else too, isn't she?
Balthus seems pretty taken with her...",
32226,SUPPORT,"I used to be a rather important person in the church,
but...I am in exile for committing a crime.",
32226,SUPPORT,I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed!,
32226,SUPPORT,"My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church
wasn't putting in enough to rebuild...",
32226,SUPPORT,"Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as
many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?",
32226,SUPPORT,No. The men aren't as few as that.,
32226,SUPPORT,Yes. Easily twice as many women.,
32226,SUPPORT,"Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something.",
32226,SUPPORT,No way. You got eyes? Take a look around.,
32226,SUPPORT,"I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter
down here—nowhere else to go.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their
strongest people to this fight.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Count Bergliez in the Empire, Lord Holst in the
Alliance... I'm sure the Kingdom's got someone too.",
32226,SUPPORT,What a pain. What an absolute pain...,
32226,SUPPORT,What's the matter?,
32226,SUPPORT,...,
32226,SUPPORT,"Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Here's a word of warning—if anyone here asks you
for a favor, it's probably just a scam.",
32226,SUPPORT,...,
32226,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Remember that battle six years ago? Oh... Um,
I'm guessing you do. Anyway, remember that knight
who watched over Abyss with me for a while?",
32226,SUPPORT,"I've been on the hunt for his whereabouts and...
I finally found out what happened to him.",
32226,SUPPORT,"My friend...is no longer with us. Dead. Figured as
much, but now I know for sure. I did get to meet his
big sister, at least.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I'll never have the chance to thank him for our time
together...but maybe I can find a way to help out his
sister instead. Bet he would have liked that.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there
recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff.",
32226,SUPPORT,"There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five
years on... It's just a fact of life.",
32226,SUPPORT,"What? There have been lots of battles on the surface
recently? I hadn't heard! See what I mean?",
32226,SUPPORT,"Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here.
I'm in hiding from the army.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get
away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Justice, ambition—what does any of that matter if
you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?",
32226,SUPPORT,"Those lights that came down on Merceus...I might
have seen them before, here at Garreg Mach.",
32226,SUPPORT,"They looked like they'd rain down right on top of us,
but at the last moment, they veered off...",
32226,SUPPORT,"I think they crashed into Ailell. It must have been
the goddess's blessing that protected us.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32226,SUPPORT,"I hear we conquered the Imperial capital...but the
war's still not over? Not sure how much sense that
makes, but then, making sense of things isn't my job.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Look out for yourself in the next battle. Got it?
I'll have lots more things to report by then. That's a
promise. In the meantime, I'll be cheering you on.",
32226,SUPPORT,I've got a message for ya...from a dead man.,
32226,SUPPORT,"The Emperor was keeping the archbishop alive as
insurance against those who slither in the dark.",
32226,SUPPORT,"""When you go to Shambhala,"" the message says,
""take the archbishop with you.""",
32226,SUPPORT,"Nothing tastes better than a drink to celebrate
the fall of the Empire!",
32226,SUPPORT,"You know... Fraldarius, one of the 10 Elites, is a
distant ancestor of mine.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Even if the Kingdom as we know it no longer exists,
there's a poetic justice in taking the Empire down.",
32226,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32226,SUPPORT,"War is over! And it's all thanks to you. That's no
small feat, and I bet it took a lot of hard work.
On behalf of the world, thank you!",
32226,SUPPORT,"On a personal note...I'm, uh, chewing on an idea.
Marriage. I'm thinking of getting hitched! If I do...
I may have to move up top.",
32226,SUPPORT,"The idea of leaving my post is terrifying, to be
honest. Not sure what a life up top would even look
like. But for her, I'll figure it out. She's worth it.",
32226,SUPPORT,"So you've managed to make it all the way to the end.
For once, it seems the stars were wrong.",
32226,SUPPORT,"My reading of the stars predicted that, during the
war, you would fall to your death.",
32226,SUPPORT,"But that was five years ago. Perhaps the prediction
was true for you then somehow.",
32227,SUPPORT,"You've been snoozing awhile, so allow me to fill you
in. There's a madman roaming Faerghus.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Imperial troops entering Kingdom settlements are
destroyed seemingly overnight.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Townspeople on the front lines are terrified, and yet
they simultaneously treat this as though he's some
sort of hero blazing through the land.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Can't imagine their surprise when they realized it
was their own prince.",
32227,SUPPORT,"These past five years have been so chaotic, even the
bounty hunters backed off. I kinda miss the chase.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I don't have family ties worth fighting for, so these
muscles are up for grabs. Use me as you see fit, pal.",
32227,SUPPORT,I'm counting on you.,
32227,SUPPORT,I'm not sure about your motivation...,
32227,SUPPORT,"You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and
I'll smash it up for ya.",
32227,SUPPORT,"By that, you mean, ""Thank you, Magnanimous King
of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome.",
32227,SUPPORT,"If you're worried my skills have dulled from disuse,
think again. I've been fighting thieves to stay sharp.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! You have the look of someone relieved
to see me.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Before you ask, yes. My superior spellcraft is yours.
It's your reward for waiting so patiently for me.",
32227,SUPPORT,Are you sure?,
32227,SUPPORT,It would help me a lot.,
32227,SUPPORT,"I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough.
I recommend that you accept my generous offer.",
32227,SUPPORT,Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying.,
32227,SUPPORT,"But my assistance has a price. I expect you to aid me
in fulfilling my dream of restoring House Nuvelle.",
32227,SUPPORT,"You're back, finally! I've been waiting for so long.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I thought you might have died. But I didn't have
anywhere else to go, so...I stayed here.",
32227,SUPPORT,Sorry to keep you waiting.,
32227,SUPPORT,Thanks for sticking around.,
32227,SUPPORT,I'll think about forgiving you.,
32227,SUPPORT,You're welcome. It wasn't easy.,
32227,SUPPORT,"I've been kinda lonely. As you might have noticed,
we've lost a few people down here.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The Valley of Torment, huh? I see your angle, but
don't let your guard down.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Any movement about their borders, and the lords of
the Kingdom will react swiftly. Don't underestimate
them.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Keep your focus on a positive outcome. There's a lot
to gain and a lot to lose.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I wonder how many soldiers that Rodrigue guy
will lend us...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Not that it matters much. Taking on the whole damn
Empire... Not even I would bet on those odds.",
32227,SUPPORT,Even a small chance is worth fighting for.,
32227,SUPPORT,We'll give it our all.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Now you're talkin', pal. I love a nice, reckless
gamble. Oof, now I'm excited!",
32227,SUPPORT,"Well, yeah. If we don't, we'll die a terrible death.
I've survived this long. I refuse to give up now.",
32227,SUPPORT,"You know... Win or lose, I guess it's not worth
betting on. Who would I collect from after the
war's over?",
32227,SUPPORT,"So you intend to march into Ailell. Frankly,
I want no part of it.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Surely, such an uneventful journey won't require
my presence.",
32227,SUPPORT,So you're staying here?,
32227,SUPPORT,I'll need you with us.,
32227,SUPPORT,And miss my share of the glory? Unacceptable.,
32227,SUPPORT,You will? Then...I shall don my marching boots.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Though I would ask that we at least consider
marching only under cover of night.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The Valley of Torment... Isn't that the place where
it's scorching hot year-round?",
32227,SUPPORT,"You know, I've always wanted to see the world.
That's why I left my village.",
32227,SUPPORT,"And here I am, traveling to all these interesting new
places...to kill people. Not what I had in mind.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'll find some time to admire the scenery.
Though people might get mad I'm not taking this
silly war seriously...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Oops, that was close. Almost sighed.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Damn, who'd have thought that House Rowe would
show up.",
32227,SUPPORT,"They must've been sweating blood to get to Ailell
from way out there.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Guess it's been a while since I left House Rowe, so it
doesn't bother me much to have to fight them.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Kinda always knew I'd be the one to take that
stubborn old donkey out. I've been ready for this.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I hear Claude's gonna fight the good fight with us.
Heh, not a bad ally to have, that one.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Something about him is untrustworthy, but from
what I hear, he's a man who keeps his promises.",
32227,SUPPORT,Are you two on friendly terms?,
32227,SUPPORT,Are you sure you don't mind?,
32227,SUPPORT,"Eh, sort of? We're both Alliance nobility, and we've
crossed paths a handful of times these past five years.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It's fine by me. At least until we pass the Great
Bridge, he'll be valuable from a tactical standpoint.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I honestly have no clue what will happen after we
cross the bridge...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Invading the Empire at last, are we? I cannot still
the wild palpitations in my chest.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I have made myself ready to the extent that I could,
but now that the day draws near...",
32227,SUPPORT,"I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of
restoring the Imperial house of Nuvelle.",
32227,SUPPORT,"However, if we succeed in defeating the Empire
and rebuilding the Kingdom, I may yet achieve
my dream.",
32227,SUPPORT,"That sorcerer who runs the Kingdom capital...
Cornelia's her name, yeah?",
32227,SUPPORT,"The woman who kidnapped me was called
that too. But it's probably just a coincidence.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Super common name. You can't swing a dead cat
without hitting a Cornelia. Right?",
32227,SUPPORT,"That Duke Fraldarius is a rather upstanding guy.
Getting into his good graces isn't without challenges.",
32227,SUPPORT,"If he were a bit more corrupt, he'd be much more
pliable.",
32227,SUPPORT,Enough with that.,
32227,SUPPORT,Oh?,
32227,SUPPORT,"I'm not trying to pull anything funny. Just noting
that he's a respectable soldier.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I hear he's the sort to have drinks with his men,
getting to know them personally.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Just last night, he and Felix had a chat. I'm sure
there's a lot to work out between them.",
32227,SUPPORT,"We've seen the face of evil. One of its faces at least.
Even the Alliance is involved now...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Hopefully we can avoid dragging Alliance territory
through the horrors of war.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I may have cut ties with my family, but I still want
them to be safe and all...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Across the bridge is Bergliez territory. It marks the
start of our incursion into the Empire.",
32227,SUPPORT,Worry not. I feel no trepidation as we do this.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Mark how my spellcraft carries us through to Enbarr,
heart of the Empire!",
32227,SUPPORT,"We're fighting people we used to know from the
Officers Academy.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Guess that's the kind of thing that happens in war,
but...still. It's pretty twisted.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It makes me feel so... Oof. Maybe I'll just try not to
think about it.",
32227,SUPPORT,"We've come so far... I hate that we're headed to the
Kingdom capital now.",
32227,SUPPORT,"But it's not like we have much choice. We don't have
the numbers to face the Empire head on.",
32227,SUPPORT,So we've just gotta shut it and deal.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Get this, pal. I swung by the training ground and ran
into that Dimitri guy. Haven't seen him in ages.",
32227,SUPPORT,"He seems less rabid, but he's still too damn serious.
It's depressing.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I challenged him to a brawl, hoping for a quick
knockout. Didn't work out that way. We went at it
for quite a while. He's a tough one.",
32227,SUPPORT,You're too reckless.,
32227,SUPPORT,You should have invited me.,
32227,SUPPORT,"What was I supposed to do? Invite him to tea?
Trade hugs? Ha! Not in a million years, pal.",
32227,SUPPORT,"True. The two of us could have taken him down,
no problem.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Between you and me...the man is stunning in battle!
Nearly on par with myself! Bet the ladies can't
get enough.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It's a shame that our path is taking us far from the
Imperial capital, but I don't feel too badly about it.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It takes us closer to the Fhirdiad School of Sorcery,
where I explored many branches of study.",
32227,SUPPORT,"This way, I can repay my debt to the teachers who
gave me such invaluable guidance.",
32227,SUPPORT,"If we're going to the Kingdom capital, that means
I'll run into the lady who... Well, you know.",
32227,SUPPORT,You must be eager to face her.,
32227,SUPPORT,Your old archenemy...,
32227,SUPPORT,"No, I'm definitely not in a rush to confront that one.",
32227,SUPPORT,"That's a bit much. I'm not nearly pompous enough
to call anyone my ""archenemy.""",
32227,SUPPORT,"We'll just have to see what happens when I meet her
face-to-face.",
32227,SUPPORT,"So the king who came back from hell defeated the
tyrant and liberated the people.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It's like something out of a poetic saga. At least
those in need will see it as such.",
32227,SUPPORT,You think so?,
32227,SUPPORT,How do you see it?,
32227,SUPPORT,"It isn't like the poor need some lofty heir basking
in glory.",
32227,SUPPORT,"What they need is someone who can ease their woes,
keep them fed. Things like that.",
32227,SUPPORT,"How they view such a king all depends on his ability
to provide for them.",
32227,SUPPORT,"All things considered, I imagine Dimitri will do a
fine job at it.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It's happened. The Alliance is now little more than a
battlefield. I guess that was inevitable...",
32227,SUPPORT,"So far, Albrecht territory has remained unscathed.
But that won't last forever.",
32227,SUPPORT,We'll win this for the Alliance as well.,
32227,SUPPORT,There's no time to waste.,
32227,SUPPORT,"When I see that Arundel guy, I'm gonna knock
him flat.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I appreciate the sentiment, pal, but we can't just rush
into this thing. Let's make sure we're ready, yeah?",
32227,SUPPORT,"We're short on time, but we have to go in prepared.
If we lose this, we lose everything. The stakes are too
damn high.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I was most relieved to hear that no one at the
school of sorcery was harmed.",
32227,SUPPORT,"They are capable people who bear Fódlan's future on
their shoulders. We can afford to lose none of them.",
32227,SUPPORT,It's good that Fhirdiad is ours once again.,
32227,SUPPORT,Enbarr is beyond our reach now...,
32227,SUPPORT,"Yes, the future of magic is bright! Though it would
be brighter if my own house's future was guaranteed.",
32227,SUPPORT,"In exchange for securing a bright future for magic
in Fódlan, that is a small price to pay.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The Alliance is next on our agenda, yes? Ahaha!
Watch carefully for my dazzling spellcraft!",
32227,SUPPORT,"People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and
nobles clashing over territory. Things like that.",
32227,SUPPORT,"So before the war, when folks talked about how
peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent
are you living on?""",
32227,SUPPORT,"I get it now. A few isolated skirmishes here and there
are nothing compared to a full-blown war.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The one truly peaceful place I've known was the
village where I grew up.",
32227,SUPPORT,"We need to mop up the mess in the Kingdom
quickly.",
32227,SUPPORT,"My family lives in Faerghus. As do my people. I want
to avoid exposing them to danger.",
32227,SUPPORT,Your family?,
32227,SUPPORT,Your people?,
32227,SUPPORT,"My mother. She's been ill for a long time now.
Moving her away just isn't an option.",
32227,SUPPORT,"That's right. Those who work for me and with me.
They've entrusted their lives to me. They trust me.",
32227,SUPPORT,"So for them, more than anything, I hope we can end
this swiftly and give everyone the lives they deserve.",
32227,SUPPORT,So... Claude abandoned the Alliance and ran off.,
32227,SUPPORT,"I have a pretty good idea of where he went.
Where anyone would go in his situation.
Somewhere he belongs.",
32227,SUPPORT,What's he going to do there?,
32227,SUPPORT,Where did he go?,
32227,SUPPORT,"He must've gone there to do something he can't
achieve in Fódlan.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Heh, good question. Here's a hint... He's probably
not in Fódlan anymore.",
32227,SUPPORT,"He may be gone, but he left his troubles behind.
Now it's on us to clean up his mess.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It's not that I don't sympathize with Lady Edelgard's
goals, mind you.",
32227,SUPPORT,"But perhaps not to the point of shedding blood for
her ideals.",
32227,SUPPORT,Perhaps not.,
32227,SUPPORT,Some ideals are worth fighting for.,
32227,SUPPORT,"I must keep her example in mind as I chart
a new path.",
32227,SUPPORT,Of course. But I've gone down a different road.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Peace in Fódlan and a restored House Nuvelle
shall be my guiding star as I blaze my own trail!",
32227,SUPPORT,"Everyone seems pumped about fighting the Empire
at long last.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Personally, I find it difficult to get excited about
killing people, no matter what side they're on.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I'm on yours. It's that simple. If you fought alongside
the Imperial army, so would I.",
32227,SUPPORT,...,
32227,SUPPORT,This is a rare sight.,
32227,SUPPORT,Are you praying?,
32227,SUPPORT,"How would you know what's rare and what isn't?
I still believe in the goddess, sort of.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I am. It's a bit of a ritual for me to pray to her before
something big like this.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I couldn't recount a single word of scripture for you,
but my mother always prayed, herself.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Believe it or not, I'm praying for you too. For you to
come back safe.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Is it true what they say? That the archbishop is a
captive of the Empire?",
32227,SUPPORT,"I've never heard of anything so brash in all the
Empire's long history.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It is vexing that Lady Edelgard's true motives elude
me. If only I still had noble connections to draw on...",
32227,SUPPORT,"The loss of my house has proven to be a thorn in my
side again and again.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The war might be over soon. All this time we've been
fighting, and the end comes in the blink of an eye.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I have no idea what I'll do afterwards, though.
I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.",
32227,SUPPORT,You should figure it out now.,
32227,SUPPORT,It's OK to take your time.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Easy for you to say. You obviously know what you're
going to do. Which is...what, exactly?",
32227,SUPPORT,"I will. Though you already seem to know what you're
going to do. Which is...what, exactly?",
32227,SUPPORT,"Actually, don't tell me your plans just yet. Let's
revisit this topic when the war has drawn to a close.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years,
hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard.",
32227,SUPPORT,"That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in
and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Seems to me things are pretty tough up top, anyhow.
These days, it's probably cozier down here than it is
up there. How's that for a change of pace?",
32227,SUPPORT,A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started.,
32227,SUPPORT,"People are saying it was the church that used to keep
order around here.",
32227,SUPPORT,But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports
need to be reported. And for all reportable things,
I'm your guy.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Bandits from Garreg Mach used to come down to
Abyss pretty frequently.",
32227,SUPPORT,"We never dealt with them though. We refused their
offers at every turn. Sometimes we had to use force.",
32227,SUPPORT,"It was Hapi who finally drove them out for good.
Only then there were beasts all over the place...",
32227,SUPPORT,"When the monastery fell to ruin, we lost all hope
for support from the church.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Most able-bodied folks abandoned Abyss for the
surface around that time.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Since then, we've been barely scraping by...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Some Kingdom noble called Rodrigue has been
footing the bill to feed the people of Garreg Mach.
Feeding the hungry with his own gold... Just, wow!",
32227,SUPPORT,"Even the folks down here have been getting a share
of the provisions. Needless to say, this Rodrigue guy
is popular these days. We're all very grateful.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I heard the Kingdom fell. If that's true, why are there
Kingdom soldiers right above us?",
32227,SUPPORT,Do you know what's going on?,
32227,SUPPORT,The Kingdom hasn't fallen yet.,
32227,SUPPORT,The prince is putting it back together.,
32227,SUPPORT,"That so? Sounds like a good business opportunity.
Thanks for the tip. Time to rake in some gold.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Not sure what brought people back up above,
but I'm glad for it.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The dining hall, the greenhouse... They're all ripe
for the picking again.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Uh, I mean, for them! Good for them!",
32227,SUPPORT,"I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter
down here—nowhere else to go.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their
strongest people to this fight.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The Great Tree Moon is finally upon us. It's time to
celebrate a new year. We only get so many!",
32227,SUPPORT,"Folks up top don't seem to be in the mood to
celebrate though. I hate war...",
32227,SUPPORT,What a pain. What an absolute pain.,
32227,SUPPORT,What's the matter?,
32227,SUPPORT,...,
32227,SUPPORT,"Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Here's a word of warning—if anyone here asks you
for a favor, it's probably just a scam.",
32227,SUPPORT,...,
32227,SUPPORT,"Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here.
I'm in hiding from the army.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get
away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Justice, ambition—what does any of that matter if
you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?",
32227,SUPPORT,"I used to be a rather important person in the church,
but...I am in exile for committing a crime.",
32227,SUPPORT,I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed!,
32227,SUPPORT,"My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church
wasn't putting in enough to rebuild...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I hear there was a huge battle recently. Glad to see
you made it back safe and sound.",
32227,SUPPORT,"Maybe there's life after death, or maybe that's just a
bunch of pretty words. Either way, we should live
like our time here is all we've got.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I've...been close with one of the Kingdom soldiers
I met in town...",
32227,SUPPORT,"He talked about how he hated the war. We'd just
gotten engaged... I thought he'd stay...",
32227,SUPPORT,"He didn't want to invade the Empire, but he left for
the front anyway... He never came back...",
32227,SUPPORT,"I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there
recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff.",
32227,SUPPORT,"There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five
years on... It's just a fact of life.",
32227,SUPPORT,"What? There have been lots of battles on the surface
recently? I hadn't heard! See what I mean?!",
32227,SUPPORT,"Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as
many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?",
32227,SUPPORT,No. The men aren't as few as that.,
32227,SUPPORT,Yes. Easily twice as many women.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something.",
32227,SUPPORT,No way. You got eyes? Take a look around.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"I hear Derdriu is our next objective. Small world.
That's actually where I grew up. It's a great place.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The army runs you ragged. Marches you from place
to place, prodding you to fight.",
32227,SUPPORT,"They promised me three meals a day... They'd have
to give a lot more than that to get me to sign on.",
32227,SUPPORT,I'd rather starve down here than deal with that.,
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The Alliance is a thing of the past now. Times are
changing fast these days. It's hard to keep up, even
for me!",
32227,SUPPORT,"I wonder if Abyss is on the verge of change too.
Change leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty leads
to...change? I dunno. I'm just a guard.",
32227,SUPPORT,"So the Alliance is finished, is it? The leader's gone?",
32227,SUPPORT,That damn prince. Seems my role here is at an end.,
32227,SUPPORT,"No matter. Should another chance present itself,
I'll take a less subtle route...",
32227,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32227,SUPPORT,"The war is careening headfirst toward its grand
finale. Do me a favor and get through this mess
alive, OK?",
32227,SUPPORT,"After the dust settles, maybe I'll go on to guard
other entrances in other parts of the world. I'm a
dreamer, my friend. Always have been.",
32227,SUPPORT,"We're getting along a lot better with the Kingdom
soldiers recently. Everyone's in higher spirits.",
32227,SUPPORT,"When they first got here, some of them were
aggressive toward us...even abusive.",
32227,SUPPORT,"All that's changed now. They've been courteous with
us. Generous, even. It's nice to see.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Well, hello. It's been a while, hasn't it? Are you really
so surprised to see me here?",
32228,SUPPORT,"I flew here just as soon as I heard you were alive.
I care more than you may realize.",
32228,SUPPORT,I'm happy you came.,
32228,SUPPORT,There's much to be done. Let's work together.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does
make my heart flutter a bit.",
32228,SUPPORT,Yes. Let's.,
32228,SUPPORT,"So long as our efforts are aligned, I'll happily work
alongside you.",
32228,SUPPORT,"These past five years have been so chaotic, even the
bounty hunters backed off. I kinda miss the chase.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I don't have family ties worth fighting for, so these
muscles are up for grabs. Use me as you see fit, pal.",
32228,SUPPORT,I'm counting on you.,
32228,SUPPORT,I'm not sure about your motivation...,
32228,SUPPORT,"You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and
I'll smash it up for ya.",
32228,SUPPORT,"By that, you mean, ""Thank you, Magnanimous King
of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome.",
32228,SUPPORT,"If you're worried my skills have dulled from disuse,
think again. I've been fighting thieves to stay sharp.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Ahaha! You have the look of someone relieved
to see me.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Before you ask, yes. My superior spellcraft is yours.
It's your reward for waiting so patiently for me.",
32228,SUPPORT,Are you sure?,
32228,SUPPORT,It would help me a lot.,
32228,SUPPORT,"I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough.
I recommend that you accept my generous offer.",
32228,SUPPORT,Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying.,
32228,SUPPORT,"But my assistance has a price. I expect you to aid me
in fulfilling my dream of restoring House Nuvelle.",
32228,SUPPORT,"You're back, finally! I've been waiting for so long.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I thought you might have died. But I didn't have
anywhere else to go, so...I stayed here.",
32228,SUPPORT,Sorry to keep you waiting.,
32228,SUPPORT,Thanks for sticking around.,
32228,SUPPORT,I'll think about forgiving you.,
32228,SUPPORT,You're welcome. It wasn't easy.,
32228,SUPPORT,"I've been kinda lonely. As you might have noticed,
we've lost a few people down here.",
32228,SUPPORT,"The Valley of Torment, huh? I see your angle, but
don't let your guard down.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Any movement about their borders, and the lords of
the Kingdom will react swiftly. Don't underestimate
them.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Keep your focus on a positive outcome. There's a lot
to gain and a lot to lose.",
32228,SUPPORT,"So Judith is on our side now. That right?
Haven't seen that lady in years.",
32228,SUPPORT,"These days, people call her a hero. Back then, I just
called her a catch and a half.",
32228,SUPPORT,How long ago did you know her?,
32228,SUPPORT,"You two weren't...friends, were you?",
32228,SUPPORT,"Quite a while. I was a kid back then, but she caught
my eye when she came to one of the Alliance dances.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Ha! If only. Nah, I was a kid at the time, but she still
managed to catch my eye.",
32228,SUPPORT,"She was the second loveliest lady in all of Fódlan.
Who's the first, you ask? Heh, that's my little secret...",
32228,SUPPORT,"So you intend to march into Ailell. Frankly,
I want no part of it.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Surely, such an uneventful journey won't require
my presence.",
32228,SUPPORT,So you're staying here?,
32228,SUPPORT,I'll need you with us.,
32228,SUPPORT,And miss my share of the glory? Unacceptable.,
32228,SUPPORT,You will? Then...I shall don my marching boots.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Though I would ask that we at least consider
marching only under cover of night.",
32228,SUPPORT,"The Valley of Torment... Isn't that the place where
it's scorching hot year-round?",
32228,SUPPORT,"You know, I've always wanted to see the world.
That's why I left my village.",
32228,SUPPORT,"And here I am, traveling to all these interesting new
places...to kill people. Not what I had in mind.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'll find some time to admire the scenery.
Though people might get mad I'm not taking this
silly war seriously...",
32228,SUPPORT,"Oops, that was close. Almost sighed.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Damn, who'd have thought that House Rowe would
show up.",
32228,SUPPORT,"They must've been sweating blood to get to Ailell
from way out there.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Guess it's been a while since I left House Rowe, so it
doesn't bother me much to have to fight them.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Kinda always knew I'd be the one to take that
stubborn old donkey out. I've been ready for this.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Huh. That lady hasn't changed a bit since I was
a kid. Still intimidating as hell. What a woman.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Being me, I'm not nervous or anything. I just...
I'm not sure how to approach her, that's all.",
32228,SUPPORT,"My luck, she'll treat me like I'm still a kid, even
though I'm clearly a full-grown adult man.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Hm. If that's the angle she takes, maybe I can get
some nice hugs out of this... Huh?! Oh, nothing.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Invading the Empire at last, are we? I cannot still
the wild palpitations in my chest.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I have made myself ready to the extent that I could,
but now that the day draws near...",
32228,SUPPORT,"I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of
restoring the Imperial house of Nuvelle.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Which leaves me with no choice but to appeal to
you and Claude for that. My dream is in your hands.",
32228,SUPPORT,I've never met someone like Judy.,
32228,SUPPORT,"She's easygoing, but at the same time, tough as nails.
I bet she'd be real fun to hang out with.",
32228,SUPPORT,I like her too.,
32228,SUPPORT,She scares me a little.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know?",
32228,SUPPORT,"Judy's great. Unlike that other guy,
Lord What's-His-Name.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I can't stand people like him—people who think
they're always in the right.",
32228,SUPPORT,"All he did was make trouble, but he convinced
himself it was for a good cause. So infuriating.",
32228,SUPPORT,"My rule is never to play my hand if I can't win.
That's why I'm here. To win.",
32228,SUPPORT,"This is my life on the line. Don't let me down, yeah?",
32228,SUPPORT,"In the end, I'm the one who decided to be a part of
this, so it's my own fault if things go south.",
32228,SUPPORT,"It seems the Alliance has avoided becoming nothing
but a glorified battlefield.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I may have cut ties with my family, but I'll admit,
I'm still worried about how they're faring...",
32228,SUPPORT,"For now at least, my little bro has managed to keep
them afloat. He's a good leader, that one.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Across the bridge is Bergliez territory. It marks the
start of our incursion into the Empire.",
32228,SUPPORT,Worry not. I feel no trepidation as we do this.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Mark how my spellcraft carries us through to Enbarr,
heart of the Empire!",
32228,SUPPORT,"We're fighting people we used to know from the
Officers Academy.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Guess that's the kind of thing that happens in war,
but...still. It's pretty twisted.",
32228,SUPPORT,"It makes me feel so... Oof. Maybe I'll just try not to
think about it.",
32228,SUPPORT,"If the Empire rallies its forces and attacks Garreg
Mach, I'm not so sure Abyss will be OK...",
32228,SUPPORT,"If we're not careful, it'll end up buried in rubble.",
32228,SUPPORT,You really think so?,
32228,SUPPORT,I won't let that happen.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Like I said, only if we're not careful. If it comes down
to it, I'll protect this place till my dying breath.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Heh heh... Ever the valiant one. But nobody ever
knows how a war will turn out. That's part of the
deal, you know?",
32228,SUPPORT,"Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I want to ensure
there is still a refuge for people to escape to.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I hear Hilda proposed a genius plan. That right?
Heh, we've got a little strategist on our hands.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Not too long ago, she was just a tiny girl who
couldn't do a thing on her own. Now look at her.
She's the fiercest of the fierce.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I wonder what Holst would say if he saw her now.
I bet he'd be proud...just like me.",
32228,SUPPORT,"It's not that I don't sympathize with Lady Edelgard's
goals, mind you.",
32228,SUPPORT,"But perhaps not to the point of shedding blood for
her ideals.",
32228,SUPPORT,Perhaps not.,
32228,SUPPORT,Some ideals are worth fighting for.,
32228,SUPPORT,"I must keep her example in mind as I chart
a new path.",
32228,SUPPORT,Of course. But I've gone down a different road.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Peace in Fódlan and a restored House Nuvelle
shall be my guiding star as I blaze my own trail!",
32228,SUPPORT,"People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and
nobles clashing over territory. Things like that.",
32228,SUPPORT,"So before the war, when folks talked about how
peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent
are you living on?""",
32228,SUPPORT,"I get it now. A few isolated skirmishes here and there
are nothing compared to a full-blown war.",
32228,SUPPORT,"The one truly peaceful place I've known was the
village where I grew up.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Claude's quite the idealist, isn't he? Not that I've got
room to talk.",
32228,SUPPORT,"His ambitions are lofty and, well, reckless. One false
move, and Fódlan is done for.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Although, unrelenting idealism with a dash of
recklessness can change the world.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Destroying the walls that separate Fódlan from the
outside world strikes me as a bold step.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I've spent so long struggling to reclaim the past that
Claude's vision of the future casts me in a poor light.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Oh! Did you think I was serious? Ahahaha!
As if I would ever admit to a fault.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Ensuring that the tradition of House Nuvelle
continues uninterrupted is a noble task!",
32228,SUPPORT,"I don't know much about Almyrans, but I guess
I have something in common with them.",
32228,SUPPORT,"We're viewed as different because of where we came
from. There must be a lot of people like us.",
32228,SUPPORT,There are a lot.,
32228,SUPPORT,I'm not really sure.,
32228,SUPPORT,"That's what I thought. People from the north,
the west, and even some isolated communities
within Fódlan.",
32228,SUPPORT,"You're not sure? Well, I bet there are.",
32228,SUPPORT,"And if that's the case, maybe Claudester's got the
right idea.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Slithering in darkness. Unsettling to say the least.
You must be boiling to avenge your father though.",
32228,SUPPORT,Absolutely.,
32228,SUPPORT,"I don't feel that way, exactly...",
32228,SUPPORT,"You seem pretty calm for what it is we're staring at.
Where's your fire, huh?",
32228,SUPPORT,"I've gotta say, I wish you were a little more fiery
about all this.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Though, I suppose a lot of time has passed since your
father died.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I imagine this battle will be a defining moment in
history. All or nothing. Let's do this.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I thought defeating the Empire would be the end of
it, but now we're after some mysterious shadow
organization? For crying out loud...",
32228,SUPPORT,"If only Holst had come along for the ride. But he's
working out things with Almyra or something, yeah?",
32228,SUPPORT,"Even so, maybe we better warn him about those-
who-whatever-in-the-dark. They might be
whatevering in his neck of the woods too.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Me aside, no one's on the same level as Holst. If the
Alliance is attacked while he's gone, they'll be in
trouble.",
32228,SUPPORT,Whatever threatens Fódlan also threatens my dream.,
32228,SUPPORT,This folly must end now!,
32228,SUPPORT,Aren't you scared?,
32228,SUPPORT,Do you think we have a chance?,
32228,SUPPORT,"Fear is not a consideration of mine. I do what must
be done and always have.",
32228,SUPPORT,"You go to war harboring such doubts? Pray keep
these fainthearted ruminations to yourself!",
32228,SUPPORT,"What is frightening is to have scant idea of what is
in store. Now that we know, victory shall be ours.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Sounds like there were shenanigans happening
behind the scenes in the Empire.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I think war was basically inevitable no matter what
Eddy did, with those creeps pulling the strings.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Come to think of it, I wonder if the lady who
kidnapped me was...",
32228,SUPPORT,Never mind. Not worth mentioning.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Throughout my life, I'm always calculating—always
trying to suss out what will happen next.",
32228,SUPPORT,"But this? I never could've predicted Nemesis rising
from his grave and coming to kill us all. Who'd have
figured, you know?",
32228,SUPPORT,It's quite a surprise...,
32228,SUPPORT,I figured that.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Then again, if I were able to predict everything,
life would be a drag. I intend to lean into the
chaos, heh heh.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Cute. But not that cute right now. Anyway, we're
backed into a corner, so may as well make the most
of it, yeah?",
32228,SUPPORT,"In the end, I guess it's a good thing Holst isn't
joining us...",
32228,SUPPORT,"If Nemesis could rough up my buddy that bad,
he must be tough as hell.",
32228,SUPPORT,Do you think we can win?,
32228,SUPPORT,We'll win no matter what.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Between the two of us, we can't lose. Not to mention
our allies. We've escaped death, and we'll do it again.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Damn straight! Between the two of us, we can't lose.
Not to mention our allies. Death has nothin' on us.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I swear to avenge Holst! Huh? He doesn't have to be
dead to be avenged. Don't play semantics with me!",
32228,SUPPORT,"I won't allow my—pardon, OUR dream to be
snuffed out by one who should be long dead!",
32228,SUPPORT,"The coming battle will demonstrate to all the world
the power that I, Constance von Nuvelle, wield!",
32228,SUPPORT,You sound eager.,
32228,SUPPORT,I look forward to that.,
32228,SUPPORT,"And why wouldn't I be? It is by these deeds that the
world will know my name—er, will know peace!",
32228,SUPPORT,You shall know it when you see it! Ahahaha!,
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years,
hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard.",
32228,SUPPORT,"That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in
and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Looks like the Knights of Seiros have returned.
I wonder if Mr. Backup is back too...",
32228,SUPPORT,A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started.,
32228,SUPPORT,"People are saying it was the church that used to keep
order around here.",
32228,SUPPORT,But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Remember that battle five years ago? Oh... Um,
I'm guessing you do. Anyway, remember that knight
who watched over Abyss with me for a while?",
32228,SUPPORT,"He said he was going to check on things up top but
that he'd return. Thing is...I haven't seen him since.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Lots of knights have returned, but not him. I hope
he's safe...",
32228,SUPPORT,"When the monastery fell to ruin, we lost all hope
for support from the church.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Most able-bodied folks abandoned Abyss for the
surface around that time.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Since then, we've been barely scraping by...",
32228,SUPPORT,"Bandits from Garreg Mach used to come down to
Abyss pretty frequently.",
32228,SUPPORT,"We never dealt with them, though. We refused their
offers at every turn. Sometimes we had to use force.",
32228,SUPPORT,"It was Hapi who finally drove them out for good.
Only then there were beasts all over the place...",
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports
need to be reported. And for all reportable things,
I'm your guy.",
32228,SUPPORT,"House Daphnel was kind enough to share their food
with us.",
32228,SUPPORT,"It may not be much in the grand scheme of things,
but the gesture means a lot.",
32228,SUPPORT,"The Hero of Daphnel is something else too, isn't she?
Balthus seems pretty taken with her...",
32228,SUPPORT,"Not sure what brought people back up above,
but I'm glad for it.",
32228,SUPPORT,"The dining hall, the greenhouse... They're all ripe
for the picking again.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Uh, I mean, for them! Good for them!",
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"The Great Tree Moon is finally upon us. It's time to
celebrate a new year. We only get so many!",
32228,SUPPORT,"Folks up top don't seem to be in the mood to
celebrate though. I hate war...",
32228,SUPPORT,"I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter
down here—nowhere else to go.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their
strongest people to this fight.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Count Bergliez in the Empire, Lord Holst in the
Alliance... I'm sure the Kingdom's got someone too.",
32228,SUPPORT,What a pain. What an absolute pain...,
32228,SUPPORT,What's the matter?,
32228,SUPPORT,...,
32228,SUPPORT,"Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Here's a word of warning—if anyone here asks you
for a favor, it's probably just a scam.",
32228,SUPPORT,...,
32228,SUPPORT,"I used to be a rather important person in the church,
but...I am in exile for committing a crime.",
32228,SUPPORT,I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed!,
32228,SUPPORT,"My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church
wasn't putting in enough to rebuild...",
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I hear there was a huge battle recently. Glad to see
you made it back safe and sound.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Maybe there's life after death, or maybe that's just a
bunch of pretty words. Either way, we should live
like our time here is all we've got.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here.
I'm in hiding from the army.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get
away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Justice, ambition—what does any of that matter if
you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?",
32228,SUPPORT,"I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there
recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff.",
32228,SUPPORT,"There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five
years on... It's just a fact of life.",
32228,SUPPORT,"What? There have been lots of battles on the surface
recently? I hadn't heard! See what I mean?!",
32228,SUPPORT,"Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as
many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?",
32228,SUPPORT,No. The men aren't as few as that.,
32228,SUPPORT,Yes. Easily twice as many women.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something.",
32228,SUPPORT,No way. You got eyes? Take a look around.,
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Remember that battle six years ago? Oh... Um,
I'm guessing you do. Anyway, remember that knight
who watched over Abyss with me for a while?",
32228,SUPPORT,"I've been on the hunt for his whereabouts and...
I finally found out what happened to him.",
32228,SUPPORT,"My friend...is no longer with us. Dead. Figured as
much, but now I know for sure. I did get to meet his
big sister, at least.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I'll never have the chance to thank him for our time
together...but maybe I can find a way to help out his
sister instead. Bet he would have liked that.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Those lights that came down on Merceus...I might
have seen them before, here at Garreg Mach.",
32228,SUPPORT,"They looked like they'd rain down right on top of us,
but at the last moment, they veered off...",
32228,SUPPORT,"I think they crashed into Ailell. It must have been
the goddess's blessing that protected us.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I hear we conquered the Imperial capital...but the
war's still not over? Not sure how much sense that
makes, but then, making sense of things isn't my job.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Look out for yourself in the next battle. Got it?
I'll have lots more things to report by then. That's a
promise. In the meantime, I'll be cheering you on.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Nothing tastes better than a drink to celebrate the
fall of the Empire!",
32228,SUPPORT,"You know... Fraldarius, one of the 10 Elites, is a
distant ancestor of mine.",
32228,SUPPORT,"Even if the Kingdom as we know it no longer exists,
there's a poetic justice in taking the Empire down.",
32228,SUPPORT,I've got a message for ya...from a dead man.,
32228,SUPPORT,"The emperor was keeping the archbishop alive as
insurance against those who slither in the dark.",
32228,SUPPORT,"""When you go to Shambhala,"" the message says,
""take the archbishop with you.""",
32228,SUPPORT,"Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report.",
32228,SUPPORT,"A nosy little bird told me some undead jerk is
coming to attack us. That's just silly, though.
Puuure silly.",
32228,SUPPORT,"On a personal note... I'm, uh, chewing on an idea.
Marriage. I'm thinking of getting hitched! If I do...
I may have to move up top.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I'd like to leave this place on my own two feet,
not in a body bag. I want to live! For her. So...
please win this one, Professor. Do it for all of us.",
32228,SUPPORT,"I came here with my grandpa, but then he fell down
and now he's not moving anymore.",
32228,SUPPORT,Did my grandpa die? I dunno what to do.,
32228,SUPPORT,Where is your father?,
32228,SUPPORT,Where is your mother?,
32228,SUPPORT,"My mommy and daddy went to a field.
They're still not back yet...",
32229,SUPPORT,"Want my help, hmm?",
32229,SUPPORT,"Sure, sure, why not. But I don't do anything for free.",
32229,SUPPORT,"In exchange, let me attend the lectures you give
those noble kids, yeah?",
32229,SUPPORT,I would appreciate your help.,
32229,SUPPORT,"Thanks, but no.",
32229,SUPPORT,It's a deal. Come on by whenever you need me.,
32229,SUPPORT,"If you're wondering why I won't come up to you,
it's because I've got people to watch over in Abyss.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Not into it, huh? It's not like I'm asking for much.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Well, you know where to find me if you change your
mind. I'm not all bad.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Want my help, hmm?",
32229,SUPPORT,"Best to forget about it. Consorting with me won't
lead to anything good for you.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Don't beat around the bush, pal. You want my help,
yeah? Can't blame ya.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Look, I get it. You're the new professor. You've got
a lot on your plate. You need backup? I'm your guy.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Fine, you've talked me into it! But I'm gonna need
you to sweeten the deal, if you catch my drift...",
32229,SUPPORT,I would appreciate your help.,
32229,SUPPORT,"Thanks, but no.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Beautiful! Now, about that sweetening...",
32229,SUPPORT,"I'll need to attend your classes whenever the mood
strikes. I get bored from time to time, all cooped up.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Not willing to budge an inch, that right? Fine.
Your loss.",
32229,SUPPORT,"You'll come around, just wait and see. We're fated to
watch each other's backs.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Don't beat around the bush, pal. You want my help,
yeah? Can't blame ya.",
32229,SUPPORT,"I get it. If I were you, I'd want to recruit me too. But
you're not ready for me. Come back when you are.",
32229,SUPPORT,Oh? Have you come to beg my assistance?,
32229,SUPPORT,"Then rejoice, for you have the aid of a Nuvelle!",
32229,SUPPORT,"You did come seeking my aid, yes? Hopefully with
something befitting my station.",
32229,SUPPORT,I would appreciate your help.,
32229,SUPPORT,"Thanks, but no.",
32229,SUPPORT,"An assignment for the Officers Academy?
How splendid!",
32229,SUPPORT,"I was a former attendee there myself, you know.
I shall be a model of grace in my duties.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Ah... You have no role worthy of me, then.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Well, one shall arise eventually, I am sure.",
32229,SUPPORT,Oh? Have you come to beg my assistance?,
32229,SUPPORT,"Much as you could clearly use my support... I have
no desire to place myself in direct sunlight.",
32229,SUPPORT,What? You wanna know if I can help out?,
32229,SUPPORT,"I've got time, but I don't want to spend it all serving
the church.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Don't make that face. Fine, fine. I'll back you up.",
32229,SUPPORT,I would appreciate your help.,
32229,SUPPORT,"Thanks, but no.",
32229,SUPPORT,"Yeah, sure thing. You know, I've never really had a
teacher before.",
32229,SUPPORT,"And it'll be my first time at the Officers Academy.
Sounds like fun.",
32229,SUPPORT,"What, you changed your mind all of a sudden?",
32229,SUPPORT,"Well, whatever. See you later, then.",
32229,SUPPORT,What? You wanna know if I can help out?,
32229,SUPPORT,"Sorry, but I think it's best if I stay down here.
The surface is crawling with knights.",
32233,SUPPORT,I've heard the rumors.,
32233,SUPPORT,It's Balthus...,
32233,SUPPORT,Might you possibly be...,
32233,SUPPORT,Want my advice?,
32233,SUPPORT,I never would have imagined...,
32233,SUPPORT,What a unique town.,
32233,SUPPORT,Who knew...,
32233,SUPPORT,Have you seen the library?,
32233,SUPPORT,There's gear here we could salvage...,
32233,SUPPORT,"I know you, Baltie...",
32233,SUPPORT,Don't knock boredom...,
32233,SUPPORT,I'd love some of what the nobles drink...,
32233,SUPPORT,Don't let that pretty face of his fool you...,
32233,SUPPORT,New here? Watch your back.,
32233,SUPPORT,Find someone else to bother.,
32233,SUPPORT,I offer my prayers to my gods.,
32233,SUPPORT,I bet you're real bad...,
32233,SUPPORT,What do they want me to say?,
32234,SUPPORT,Must be hard work.,
32234,SUPPORT,It's a real-life maze.,
32234,SUPPORT,Where are those records...?,
32234,SUPPORT,No wonder...,
32234,SUPPORT,The Ashen Wolf House...,
32234,SUPPORT,How could you know that?,
32234,SUPPORT,Something has been on my mind...,
32234,SUPPORT,Why not tell me your hidden agenda?,
32234,SUPPORT,The Four Apostles...,
32234,SUPPORT,A respectable man...,
32234,SUPPORT,I think she's the real deal.,
32234,SUPPORT,Everyone's in high spirits today.,
32234,SUPPORT,Drinks haven't gotten any better.,
32234,SUPPORT,I can't believe he's single...,
32234,SUPPORT,I came to see Aelfric.,
32234,SUPPORT,We've got Aelfric to keep an eye on things.,
32234,SUPPORT,My mother is waiting for me...,
32234,SUPPORT,Sometimes Aelfric gives out candy!,
32234,SUPPORT,You mustn't. Not ever!,
32235,SUPPORT,It's a small mercy...,
32235,SUPPORT,I'm worried.,
32235,SUPPORT,I'm sure of it...,
32235,SUPPORT,I was abducted once.,
32235,SUPPORT,We should pay close attention.,
32235,SUPPORT,What is their intent...,
32235,SUPPORT,They know we have the chalice...,
32235,SUPPORT,Is there enough data to back it up?,
32235,SUPPORT,Who could do such a dishonorable thing?,
32235,SUPPORT,Are we getting too involved?,
32235,SUPPORT,I'm a failure.,
32235,SUPPORT,There was nothing I could do.,
32235,SUPPORT,I've seen him before.,
32235,SUPPORT,"You'll lend a hand, won't you, Professor?",
32235,SUPPORT,If the Archbishop hears what happened...,
32235,SUPPORT,I have seen nothing.,
32235,SUPPORT,We've sent the children home.,
32236,SUPPORT,Well...,
32236,SUPPORT,"You're still game to help us, yeah?",
32236,SUPPORT,Is he friend or foe?,
32236,SUPPORT,Finally it makes sense.,
32236,SUPPORT,Fascinating.,
32236,SUPPORT,The mystery has only deepened.,
32236,SUPPORT,Formerly lost Crests...,
32236,SUPPORT,I'm shocked.,
32236,SUPPORT,Something doesn't feel right.,
32236,SUPPORT,Not so much as a thank-you?,
32236,SUPPORT,I'll stay by my post!,
32236,SUPPORT,As soon as Aelfric's back...,
32236,SUPPORT,We can't afford to lose him.,
32236,SUPPORT,Yuri somehow always keeps his cool.,
32236,SUPPORT,It'd be hard to see...,
32236,SUPPORT,The only way is to disappear...,
32236,SUPPORT,Good luck!,
32236,SUPPORT,They'll make sure it all turns out OK...,
32243,SUPPORT,You new around here?,
32243,SUPPORT,How're things?,
32243,SUPPORT,Everyone's talking...,
32243,SUPPORT,What a loss...,
32243,SUPPORT,You seem...different.,
32243,SUPPORT,Unexpected...,
32243,SUPPORT,It's hard on everyone...,
32243,SUPPORT,No laughing matter...,
32243,SUPPORT,How could the Alliance have disbanded?,
32243,SUPPORT,Is this finally the end?,
32243,SUPPORT,Let's rake in the dough!,
32243,SUPPORT,It's you.,
32243,SUPPORT,You survived...,
32243,SUPPORT,...,
32243,SUPPORT,The reason I'm here...,
32243,SUPPORT,The Knights of Seiros...,
32243,SUPPORT,The war nears its end...,
32243,SUPPORT,Familiar with the underground?,
32243,SUPPORT,Those Abyssian idiots...,
32243,SUPPORT,What should I do?,
32243,SUPPORT,"They all look so hungry, don't they?",
32243,SUPPORT,Thanks!,
32243,SUPPORT,Have you ever been in the sauna?,
32243,SUPPORT,Go visit the sauna!,
32243,SUPPORT,"The sauna is pretty great, isn't it?",
32243,SUPPORT,What to do...,
32243,SUPPORT,Have you found it?,
32243,SUPPORT,Thank you.,
32243,SUPPORT,Professor...,
32243,SUPPORT,I'll be waiting in the training grounds.,
32243,SUPPORT,Aww...,
32243,SUPPORT,Professor?,
32243,SUPPORT,I'll be waiting in the training grounds.,
32243,SUPPORT,Aww...,
32243,SUPPORT,What should I do?!,
32243,SUPPORT,Did you find it?,
32243,SUPPORT,Thank you!,
32243,SUPPORT,It's gone! GONE!,
32243,SUPPORT,Tell me when you find it!,
32243,SUPPORT,Thanks!,
32244,SUPPORT,You...,
32244,SUPPORT,I find the idea unsettling.,
32244,SUPPORT,"Right, the ball...",
32244,SUPPORT,The ball really brings back memories...,
32244,SUPPORT,But I'm no longer a noble...,
32244,SUPPORT,"They're not all bad, I guess.",
32244,SUPPORT,Hmm...,
32244,SUPPORT,According to a merchant...,
32244,SUPPORT,Is it true?,
32244,SUPPORT,Can you believe that nonsense?,
32244,SUPPORT,Nader the Undefeated...,
32244,SUPPORT,...,
32244,SUPPORT,$NONE,$NONE
32244,SUPPORT,"Surprised, are you?",
32244,SUPPORT,We've gotta keep our heads in the game.,
32244,SUPPORT,I knew nothing...,
32244,SUPPORT,I wonder what will happen...,
32244,SUPPORT,...,
32244,SUPPORT,Do something...,
32244,SUPPORT,Did you find it?,
32244,SUPPORT,Thank you.,
32244,SUPPORT,I wonder where she is.,
32244,SUPPORT,Did you find her?,
32244,SUPPORT,So that's where she was...,
32244,SUPPORT,Have you heard?,
32244,SUPPORT,Did you find him?,
32244,SUPPORT,That's great.,
32246,SUPPORT,Hey...,
32246,SUPPORT,Hm?,
32246,SUPPORT,Haven't seen your face before.,
32246,SUPPORT,Well?,
32246,SUPPORT,And who might you be?,
32246,SUPPORT,Ah. It's you.,
32246,SUPPORT,"You're that new professor, right?",
32246,SUPPORT,"Oh, Chatterbox.",
32246,SUPPORT,Lord Lonato...,
32246,SUPPORT,Some lowlifes are after me.,
32246,SUPPORT,Do you have some need of me?,
32246,SUPPORT,Normally I wouldn't care.,
32246,SUPPORT,Now then...,
32246,SUPPORT,My fists are itching for a brawl.,
32246,SUPPORT,What is the world coming to?,
32246,SUPPORT,I'd like to have a word.,
32246,SUPPORT,I don't want anyone thinking I'm like that.,
32246,SUPPORT,Seems like a tough gig.,
32246,SUPPORT,Nice sword.,
32246,SUPPORT,We can't say for sure...,
32246,SUPPORT,We all have our strengths.,
32246,SUPPORT,I suppose it's little surprise...,
32246,SUPPORT,I hope she's OK.,
32246,SUPPORT,The Battle of the Eagle and Lion really takes me back...,
32246,SUPPORT,"Battle of the Eagle and Lion's soon, yeah?",
32246,SUPPORT,She reminds me of someone...,
32246,SUPPORT,I'd be devastated.,
32246,SUPPORT,I'm worried about you.,
32246,SUPPORT,Tell me about this victory party...,
32246,SUPPORT,The situation seems rather dire.,
32246,SUPPORT,What the heck are you doing here?,
32246,SUPPORT,Must have been tough.,
32246,SUPPORT,Get out there and get to it!,
32246,SUPPORT,You have my condolences.,
32246,SUPPORT,Seems like you're having a hard time.,
32246,SUPPORT,The atmosphere really has changed.,
32246,SUPPORT,"Hey, pal.",
32246,SUPPORT,It seems that the rumors were true.,
32246,SUPPORT,You're still you.,
32246,SUPPORT,They'll just have to deal with the outcome.,
32246,SUPPORT,Let's give 'em a fight to remember!,
32246,SUPPORT,It shakes me to my core...,
32246,SUPPORT,War will make things even harder.,
32246,SUPPORT,What business do you have here?,
32246,SUPPORT,What are you lookin' at?,
32246,SUPPORT,Such an innocent face you have...,
32246,SUPPORT,"Hey, you.",
32246,SUPPORT,Mercy! I beg you!,
32246,SUPPORT,Despite my appearance...,
32246,SUPPORT,I've got lots to report.,
32246,SUPPORT,I'm here by request of Lord Seteth.,
32246,SUPPORT,Loosen up.,
32246,SUPPORT,This god statue speaks to me...,
32246,SUPPORT,Why is he still here...,
32246,SUPPORT,Lord Seteth requested my presence.,
32246,SUPPORT,Aelfric set this whole place up for us.,
32246,SUPPORT,If you ask me...,
32246,SUPPORT,Mr. Backup is STILL here...,
32246,SUPPORT,You can never be too vigilant.,
32246,SUPPORT,This supposed to be a joke?,
32246,SUPPORT,I think he used a secret passage...,
32246,SUPPORT,"Hey, you.",
32246,SUPPORT,People with Crests do whatever they want...,
32246,SUPPORT,"For once, we've got plenty of food!",
32246,SUPPORT,I'm not lonely. Really!,
32246,SUPPORT,Have you ever killed anyone?,
32246,SUPPORT,You can't get this on the surface...,
32246,SUPPORT,Want to help me out?,
32246,SUPPORT,How could you ever cry in a place like that?,
32246,SUPPORT,They're having a lot of fun up there...,
32246,SUPPORT,I am ordered to be leaving...,
32246,SUPPORT,Maybe now isn't the time...,
32246,SUPPORT,Whatever's about to happen...,
32246,SUPPORT,I can't believe it...,
32246,SUPPORT,How great.,
32246,SUPPORT,Look at you!,
32246,SUPPORT,I wonder if that was a mistake...,
32246,SUPPORT,Isn't that nice?,
32246,SUPPORT,I decided this is where I belong.,
32246,SUPPORT,"War's actually coming, isn't it?",
32246,SUPPORT,I'm leaving Garreg Mach. You should too.,
